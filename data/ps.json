Obvious economic problems include Europe\u2019s weak banks, China\u2019s distorted property market, political uncertainty in the West, historically high private and public debt \u2013 225% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund \u2013 and the reluctance of heavily indebted Greece and Portugal to comply with IMF programs.\n\nAdditional global economic risks, such as a major oil-market disruption that could drive prices up, are not as obvious, and thus receive less attention. Economists call such events \u201cshocks\u201d precisely because they come unexpectedly and can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nUnprecedented long-term monetary stimulus and massive spikes in public-debt burdens have left governments poorly equipped to manage the next economic downturn when \u2013 not if \u2013 it arrives. The next recession probably will not be as bad as the last one, but advanced economies will be far better prepared for it if they undergo gradual monetary-policy normalization and fiscal consolidation in the meantime.\n\nWith respect to monetary policy, the United States\u2019 unemployment rate, at around 5%, is close to what most economists consider full employment, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its target interest rate again in December. But the Fed is moving at a very slow pace.\n\nThe European Central Bank will likely extend its bond-purchasing program; but it has reason to question the results of its quantitative-easing policy, given that eurozone unemployment still averages around 10%, indicating a sizeable output gap. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continues to limp along, with the Bank of Japan now \u201cmanaging the yield curve\u201d in yet another attempt to raise inflation and growth from their current low levels.\n\nIn terms of fiscal policy, most advanced economies\u2019 public finances are suffering because policymakers have failed to implement sufficient supply-side structural reforms to control public-pension growth, reform growth-inhibiting taxes, and liberalize labor markets. These fiscal-policy failures have put too much of the burden on central banks, even though growth would more likely accelerate with productivity-enhancing supply-side measures.\n\nLately, the economists who are most influential with left-leaning politicians seem hopeful that growth, employment, and incomes will rise if policymakers embrace massive new deficit-financed spending to create demand for goods and services. They argue that with borrowing costs so low, deficit spending is virtually free, and we need not worry about high debt levels.\n\nBut this argument ignores the typically large gap between what economists devise and what politicians promise, and what public-spending programs actually deliver. As ECB President Mario Draghi has put it, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many public investments with a high rate of return.\u201d Governments should certainly cut taxes and fund initiatives that pass rigorous cost-benefit tests; but broad new spending programs usually do not yield a significant or immediate economic boost.\n\nFor starters, spending generally occurs well into the future, when economic conditions are projected to be better. As President Barack Obama, referring to his signature 2009 stimulus bill, eventually admitted, \u201cthe shovels weren\u2019t ready.\u201d Similarly, Japan has attempted government spending stimulus for decades, with little to show for it in terms of overall economic growth.\n\nTo be sure, large deficits can be benign or even desirable during recessions and wars, or when used to finance productive public investments; and in a deep, long-lasting downturn, with interest rates at or near zero, a well-timed, sensible fiscal response can theoretically help in the short term. But studies show that the multiplier effect of government spending \u2013 when it may increase GDP by more than the expenditure \u2013 shrinks rapidly after a few quarters, and then turns negative. In fact, the multiplier effect can even be negative during economic expansions when central banks maintain zero-interest rates and households expect taxes to rise when interest rates do.\n\nBecause new government purchases can devolve into counterproductive political boondoggles that spur little economic growth, another proposal one often hears is to expand government transfer payments. Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?\n\nA recent study addresses this very question. According to former Obama administration Chief Economist Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, even permanent transfer-payment increases provide stimulus for only a few months, and the effect does not spread to employment. The study concludes that the benefits from transfers are \u201cmuch less persistent, and much smaller overall, than those of tax changes.\u201d\n\nIn economies where stimulus programs are carefully vetted and can be implemented quickly, any temporary government spending should be coupled with gradual fiscal consolidation, to minimize economic risk and long-term costs. As history and theory indicate, this fiscal consolidation should happen through reduced future spending growth, especially on transfer payments. Economic policymakers should heed this lesson so that they can gradually re-arm themselves; otherwise, they could be left with no firepower when they most need it."], "2016-08-22 13:29:00": ["Yanis Varoufakis", "ATHENS \u2013 Objects of desire come at a cost.

For years, central banks\u2019 prestige has been almost unprecedentedly high. But a correction now seems inevitable, with central-bank independence becoming a key casualty.\n\nCentral banks\u2019 reputation reached a peak before and at the turn of the century, thanks to the so-called Great Moderation. Low and stable inflation, sustained growth, and high employment led many to view central banks as a kind of master of the universe, able \u2013 and expected \u2013 to manage the economy for the benefit of all. The depiction of US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan as \u201cMaestro\u201d exemplified this perception.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis initially bolstered central banks\u2019 reputation further. With resolute action, monetary authorities made a major contribution to preventing a repeat of the Great Depression. They were, yet again, lauded as saviors of the world economy.\n\nBut central banks\u2019 successes fueled excessively high expectations, which encouraged most policymakers to leave their monetary counterparts largely responsible for macroeconomic management. Such \u201cexpectational\u201d and, in turn, \u201coperational\u201d overburdening has exposed monetary policy\u2019s true limitations.\n\nIn other words, central banks\u2019 good reputation now seems to be backfiring. And \u201cpersonality overburdening\u201d \u2013 when trust in the success of monetary policy is concentrated on the person at the helm of the institution \u2013 means that individual leaders\u2019 reputations are likely to suffer as well.\n\nYet central banks cannot simply abandon their new operational burdens, particularly with regard to financial stability, which, as the 2008 crisis starkly demonstrated, cannot be maintained by price stability alone. On the contrary, a period of low and stable interest rates may even foster financial fragility, leading to a \u201cMinsky moment,\u201d when asset values suddenly collapse, bringing down the whole system. The limits of inflation targeting are now clear, and the strategy should be discarded.\n\nCentral banks now have to reconcile the need to maintain price stability with the responsibility \u2013 regardless of whether it is legally mandated \u2013 to reduce financial vulnerability. This will not be easy, not least because of another new operational burden that has been placed on many central banks: macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision.\n\nMicro-prudential supervision, in particular, implies the risk of political pressure, interference with central banks\u2019 independence, and policy conflicts, all of which could influence the behavior of financial intermediaries, by encouraging them to assume greater risk. They know that their supervisor has powerful tools at its disposal \u2013 for example, it can lower borrowing costs, thereby protecting banks (at least for a while) \u2013 and a strong interest in protecting its reputation. But, given the overburdening of central banks, reputational defense may be beyond their capacity.\n\nWhile this is a global phenomenon, the European Central Bank is exceptionally weighed down. As the central bank of the 19 member states of the European Monetary Union (EMU), the ECB also faces \u201cextra-institutional overburdening.\u201d This became apparent in May 2010, when the ECB assumed the responsibility of purchasing the government bonds of countries that otherwise would have experienced substantial increases in long-term interest rates.\n\nThat intervention was a lose-lose proposition for the ECB. It was essentially driven by politics: the ECB was picking up the slack for policymakers who were unwilling to fulfill their obligations. But if the ECB had refused to intervene, financial markets could have faced substantial turmoil, for which, rightly or wrongly, it would have been blamed.\n\nFrom that moment on, however, the ECB took on the political role of guaranteeing not only the survival of the euro, but also the continued inclusion of every EMU member country. In 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi cemented this responsibility, pledging to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. \u201cAnd believe me,\u201d he asserted, \u201cit will be enough.\u201d\n\nThis stance led many to accuse the ECB of exceeding its mandate and violating European treaties. But the European Court of Justice and the German Constitutional Court have, all in all, rejected that view. Nonetheless, further litigation regarding the ECB\u2019s unconventional monetary-policy measures is underway.\n\nAgainst this background, it is perhaps unsurprising that central-bank independence \u2013 de jure or de facto \u2013 is once again up for debate. The purpose of central-bank independence has always been to enable monetary policy to focus on maintaining price stability, without being subject to political pressure. While this approach has always been controversial, given that it implies handing substantial control over the economy to unelected technocrats, past inflationary episodes have fostered broad acceptance of central-bank independence.\n\nWhen central-bank mandates exceed price stability, however, their independence may seem increasingly out of place in a democratic society. This is particularly true for the ECB: the stronger the perceived link between the extension of the ECB\u2019s mandate and politics becomes, the more criticism its independent status will confront.\n\nThe failure of elected politicians to act appropriately \u2013 particularly in some eurozone countries \u2013 has turned central banks into the \u201conly game in town.\u201d And this is turning out to be less a boon to their prestige than a threat to their independence. The ECB, especially, is set to face growing pushback against its independent status, regardless of whether it manages to \u201csave\u201d the EMU. After all, it would have to be quite powerful to succeed \u2013 too powerful for any democracy to abide."], "2016-10-25 09:00:00": ["Howard Davies", "Howard Davies, the first chairman of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Services Authority (1997-2003), is Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

She famously asserted that she would never hand that control away, and the Bank of England was not set free until 1997, when Tony Blair\u2019s first Labour government was elected.\n\nThe Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, as the BoE is known, was 303 years old before she was allowed to make her own decisions \u2013 and her own mistakes. While both the US Federal Reserve and the German Bundesbank had long been independent, most other European countries followed suit only in the run-up to establishing a monetary union. For its part, the Bank of France had, since Napoleon, been left \u201cin the hands of the government, but not too obviously so.\u201d\n\nFor the last 20 years, central-bank independence has marked a kind of \u201cend of history\u201d for monetary policy, after many other regimes were tried and failed. In the years before the 2008 global financial crisis, independent central banks were seen as successful in controlling inflation; and countries with sizable fiscal deficits were especially enthusiastic about central-bank independence because they benefited from lower long-term interest rates. Central banks that also regulate the banking industry were asked tough questions about their insouciance in the face of rapid credit expansion, but they were widely praised for their prompt and decisive response when trouble hit.\n\nBut the period of monetary-policy consensus may be coming to an end. In the United States, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has challenged Fed governors\u2019 independence, and made it clear that he would quickly replace the Fed\u2019s leadership were he elected. In Europe, the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative-easing policies have been widely criticized, and ECB President Mario Draghi recently had to defend his approach before a highly critical German Parliament.\n\nBritish politicians have also begun to protest, even though criticizing the BoE was long considered tantamount to blaspheming in church. British Prime Minister Theresa May, in a recent speech before the Conservative Party Conference, noted that \u201cmonetary policy has had some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered \u2026 a change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hague, an influential former Conservative leader, was even more blunt when he recently issued a not-so-veiled threat: if central banks do not \u201cchange course soon, they will find their independence increasingly under attack.\u201d In that case, he added, \u201cthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end.\u201d\n\nWhile May has denied any split between her government and BoE Governor Mark Carney, it is clear that monetary policy has become a subject of political debate for the first time in 20 years. In response to these heretical outbursts, Carney has sounded emollient and understanding; and Draghi has laudably engaged with his critics\u2019 arguments.\n\nBut German Bundesbank Executive Board member Andreas Dombret tried a different tack. At a British Bankers Association Conference in London this month, he said: \u201cIt may be time for a gentle reminder that central-bank independence is not debatable,\u201d Dombret suggested. \u201cPoliticians are well-advised to not exert influence in the wrong places.\u201d\n\nOne can see Dombret\u2019s point. Careless talk about monetary policy can unsettle markets, and politicians need to be careful what they wish for. But they are unlikely to agree that central-bank independence is \u201cnot debatable.\u201d They will likely ask for more humility from the technocrats, because what politicians give, they may take away. Just because they are debating the social implications of monetary policy does not necessarily mean that they are questioning the legitimacy of those who set the dials.\n\nTo be sure, this is delicate territory. There is a powerful argument to be made that central banks, insulated from short-term political pressures, have been careful stewards of price stability, and have served the global economy well. It is not obvious that returning to politically administered interest rates would have any benefits beyond the immediate term.\n\nStill, we must accept that central banks\u2019 large-scale quantitative easing takes them into uncharted territory, where the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy is blurred. In the UK, for example, the Treasury decides on the level of economic intervention, while the BoE determines the timing and method of implementation. So, the central bank\u2019s independence is not absolute.\n\nCentral bankers must demonstrate that they understand the political pressures and unusual circumstances that zero, or even negative, interest rates create. Savers are bitterly complaining that they are being penalized for their prudence; refusing to debate this and other implications of current monetary policies is not an acceptable response.\n\nIndependence demands higher degrees of accountability and transparency, whereby policies are explained to the public. To its credit, the BoE has been showing the way forward with a series of open forums around the UK.

Moreover, growth forecasts are gloomy.

In 2015, the ECB also started an asset-buying program, which ECB President Mario Draghi promised to continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.\u201d"], "2016-12-01 14:00:00": ["Jean Pisani-Ferry", "PARIS \u2013 European leaders have devoted scant attention to the future of the eurozone since July 2012, when Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, famously committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the common currency. For more than four years, they have essentially subcontracted the eurozone\u2019s stability and integrity to the central bankers. But, while the ECB has performed the job skillfully, this quiet, convenient arrangement is coming to an end, because no central bank can solve political or constitutional conundrums. Europe\u2019s heads of state and government would be wise to start over and consider options for the eurozone\u2019s future, rather than letting circumstances decide for them.\n\nSo far, Europe\u2019s leaders have had little appetite for such a discussion. In June 2015, they only paid lip service to a report on the euro\u2019s future by the presidents of the various European institutions. A few weeks later, the issue briefly returned to the agenda when eurozone leaders spent a long late-July night arguing about whether to kick out Greece; but their stated intention to follow up and address underlying problems was short-lived. Finally, plans to respond to the Brexit shock by strengthening the eurozone were quickly ditched, owing to fear that reform would prove too divisive.\n\nThe issue, however, has not gone away. Although the monetary anesthetics administered by the ECB have reduced market tensions, nervousness has reemerged in the run-up to the Italian constitutional referendum on December 4. By end-November spreads between Italian and German ten-year bunds reached 200 basis points, a level not seen since 2014.\n\nThe worrying state of several Italian banks is one reason for the mounting concern. Brexit, and the election of a US president who advocates Americanism instead of globalism and dismisses the EU, adds the risk that voters, rather than markets, will call into question European monetary integration. Anti-euro political parties are on the rise in all major eurozone countries except Spain. In Italy, they may well command a majority.\n\nOn the economic front, the eurozone has much unfinished business. The banking union, launched in June 2012 to sever the interdependence of banks and states, has made good progress but is not yet complete. Competitiveness gaps between eurozone members have diminished, and external imbalances within it have abated, but largely thanks to the compression of domestic demand in Southern Europe; saving flows from North to South have not resumed. Unemployment gaps remain wide.\n\nThe eurozone still lacks a common fiscal mechanism as well, and Germany has flatly rejected the European Commission\u2019s recent attempt to promote a \u201cpositive stance\u201d in countries with room to boost spending. Of course, when the next recession hits, fiscal stability is likely to be in dangerously short supply.\n\nFinally, the governance of the eurozone remains excessively cumbersome and technocratic. Most ministers, not to mention legislators, appear to have become lost in a procedural morass.\n\nThis unsatisfactory equilibrium may or may not last, depending on political or financial risks \u2013 or, most likely, the interaction between them. So the question now is how to hold a fruitful discussion to map out possible responses. The obstacles are twofold: First, there is no longer any momentum toward \u201cmore Europe\u201d; on the contrary, a combination of skepticism about Europe and reluctance concerning potential transfers constitutes a major stumbling block. And, second, views about the nature and root causes of the euro crisis differ across countries. Given the dearth of political capital to spend on European responses, and disagreement on what the problem is and how to solve it, governments\u2019 excess of caution is hardly surprising.\n\nBoth obstacles can be overcome. For starters, discussion of the eurozone\u2019s future should not be framed as necessarily leading to further integration. The goal should be to make the eurozone work, which may imply giving more powers to the center in some fields, but also less in others. Fiscal responsibility, for example, should not be reduced to centralized enforcement of a common regime. It is possible to design a policy framework that embodies a more decentralized approach, empowering national institutions to monitor budgetary behavior and overall fiscal sustainability.\n\nIn fact, some steps in this direction have already been taken. Going further would imply making governments individually responsible for their misconduct \u2013 in other words, making partial debt restructuring possible within the eurozone. Such an approach would raise significant difficulties, if only because transiting to such a regime would be a hazardous journey; but options of this sort should be part of the discussion.\n\nTo overcome the second obstacle, the discussion should not start by addressing the legacy problems. Distributing a burden between creditors and debtors is inevitably acrimonious, because it is a purely zero-sum game. The history of international financial relations demonstrates that such discussions are inevitably delayed and necessarily adversarial when they take place. So the issue should not be addressed first. The seemingly realistic option of starting with immediate problems before addressing longer-term issues is only superficially attractive. In reality, discussions should start with the features of the permanent regime to be established in the longer run. Participants should explore logically coherent options until they determine if they can agree on a blueprint. It is only when agreement on a blueprint for the future has been reached that the path toward realizing it should be discussed.\n\nThere are no quick fixes to the eurozone\u2019s problems. But one thing is clear: the lack of genuine discussion on possible futures is a serious cause for concern. Silence is not always golden; for the sake of Europe\u2019s future, the hush surrounding the common currency should be broken as soon as possible."], "2016-08-12 14:30:00": ["Barry Eichengreen", "Barry Eichengreen is Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior policy adviser at the International Monetary Fund.
