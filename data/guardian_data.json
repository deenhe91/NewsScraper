{"2016-12-12": [{"author": "PC/PlayStation 4/Xbox One, Ubisoft, cert: 18\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe original Watch Dogs lacked significant innovation in a marketplace oversaturated with open-world crime capers. Its big hook \u2013 the ability to hack into cars, mobile phones or various municipal outlets and utilise them in combat \u2013 was novel but underused. The sequel, thankfully, makes up for that shortfall, and then some.\n\nLeaning heavily into the inherent silliness of internet culture, it casts a gang of self-indulgent young adults as its misfit heroes, traversing San Francisco to promote their counterculture brand by hacking into everything in sight and generally making a nuisance of themselves. It\u2019s campy, colourful and extremely entertaining, though it is also a sugary treat that\u2019s easy to forget about after the event.\n\nThe controls are loose and spongy, with travel on foot and in vehicles often resembling gliding on ice. The world can also feel peculiarly lifeless, entire streets barren of people and cars, but these are small complaints against an overall joyful experience.

Photograph: AP\n\nPC/PlayStation 4/Xbox One, Bethesda, cert: 18\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nDishonored 2 is a peculiar beast, entirely unlike anything else on the triple-A market today: a first-person stealth title with action elements, set in a steampunk fantasy world with an economy based on whale oil. Unfortunately, almost all of the game\u2019s charm is carried over wholesale from its predecessor, while the numerous failings are all its own.\n\nA tale of revolution and revenge \u2013 exactly like last time \u2013 the narrative is rushed, undernourished and yet relentlessly dull. Level design is mostly repetitive and unchallenging, full of nonsensical dead-ends and time-sink collectables that feel entirely unrelated to the environments around them. What few appealing design elements there are, such as one delightful level set within a clockwork mansion, are over as quickly as they begin.\n\nThe combat and stealth mechanics remain strong, although nothing novel is introduced to the existing foundations, and last year\u2019s Definitive Edition of the first game remains the best way to experience this unique and fascinating world. SR\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A huge creative success\u2019: Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS.\n\nNintendo, cert: 3\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe original Super Mario Maker, released last year, was a playful, intuitive peek behind the mechanics of building levels, with programming complexity and design leg-work cleverly handled in the background. Players simply tapped, dragged and selected classic Mario platforms and characters to create new scenarios.\n\nAfter the game\u2019s considerable success on the Wii U, Nintendo have done well to squeeze it on to the 3DS; it maintains its usability impressively on a smaller screen. The new version also comes with 100 Nintendo-crafted challenges and access to user-made levels from the Wii U game.\n\nHowever, while you can share your creations with other 3DS users nearby, there is no facility to share them online, as there was with the Wii U version. Yet Super Mario Maker remains a huge creative success. It not only makes game building accessible to players of any age and ability, but does so with the really gleeful sense of fun Nintendo has made its own.

role in putting the eurozone back on track for sustained growth, its president Mario Draghi said on Thursday.\n\nThe ECB will pump the \u20ac60bn a month into the euro economy as the first phase in its quantitative easing programme that Draghi said would combine with low oil prices and recovering consumer confidence to spur growth and propel inflation back up close to its 2% target.\n\nAlmost six years after the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England began pumping funds into their economies through their own QE programmes, the ECB is hopeful that driving down the long term cost of credit put continental Europe onto the same path to recovery as the US and UK.\n\nBut in a clear prompt for Greece to speed up negotiations over its huge debts, Draghi said Athens would be excluded from the latest attempt to kickstart the flagging eurozone economy until it agrees a new debt deal with Brussels.\n\nHe said Greece had already enjoyed a boost in lending by the ECB under its emergency measures, taking the total outstanding debt with Frankfurt from \u20ac50bn to \u20ac100bn or 68% of GDP. Lending more to Greek banks or to support government spending would be beyond the ECB\u2019s remit, he warned.\n\nDraghi said: \u201cThe ECB is a rule-based institution. It is not a political institution.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe central bank also raised its growth forecasts for the currency zone, predicting it would grow by 1.5% this year, up from a forecast of 1.0% made three months ago. That would be followed by 1.9% growth in 2016 (up from 1.5%).\n\nDraghi said new ECB growth forecasts reflect \u201cthe favourable impact of lower oil prices, the weaker effective exchange rate of the euro and the impact of the ECB\u2019s recent monetary policy measure,\u201d signalling that this was now the ECB\u2019s last stimulus action and an improvement of the economic situation now depends on other factors.\n\nMarkets took the confirmation of QE until at least 2017 in their stride after analysts said most elements were already known and only the details of the scheme needed to be fleshed out. The euro slipped to a fresh 11-year low while stock markets edged higher, with the FTSE 100 reaching a new record high of 6961.\n\n\n\nDraghi said buying assets on a broad-based level was the \u201cfinal set of measures,\u201d adding that governments needed to pick up the baton.\n\n\u201cIn order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the decisive implementation of product and labor market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries.\u201d\n\nThe ECB programme, christened the Public Sector Purchase Programme, will involve the purchase of \u20ac60bn of government and public agency securities each month, in a way designed to \u201cavoid interfering with the market price formation mechanism\u201d, which means purchasing a broad range of assets so as not to influence their price.\n\nSome government bonds will be off limits if they have a negative yield of more than -0.2% - a rule designed to prevent the ECB making a large loss on its investment. German two-year bonds, regarded as among the safest assets in the world, were trading at below -0.2% on Thursday and will therefore be excluded from the scheme.\n\nAthens is running out of options to fund itself despite striking a deal with the euro zone in February to extend its bailout by four months. Faced with a fall in revenues, it is expected to run out of cash by the end of March, maybe sooner.\n\nOne funding option would be to raise a \u20ac15bn cap on Athens\u2019 issuance of short-term debt. The cap has already been reached, and the ECB has a veto over lifting it.\n\nThe cap is sensitive because Greek banks have used bonds to access central bank funding and then used it to invest in more sovereign bonds, helping the state cover its short-term needs. This is what Draghi refused to consider without an agreement in Brussels on a new deal.\n\nAlex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said confidence in the eurozone remained weak despite the stimulus package and predicted that the euro would continue to fall against the dollar.\n\n\u201cPutting it mildly, there isn\u2019t a lot of confidence in the euro system at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBreaking through $1.10 will likely mean a new range is soon carved out in euro versus dollar. Given the market\u2019s current reaction to Draghi\u2019s comments, it might not be long before we see parity with the dollar.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Phillip Inman", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}]], "2016-01-28": [{"author": "Watford are set to sign the Spanish midfielder Mario Su\u00e1rez from Fiorentina for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around \u00a34m.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who has three caps for Spain, only signed for the Serie A side last summer but has failed to settle in Italy.\n\nSu\u00e1rez and Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores worked together at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the Watford manager believes he can get the midfielder\u2019s career back on track.

He was born in the New York borough of Queens, above the grocery shop owned by his family, illiterate immigrants from south of Naples. He grew up to be a professional baseball player; a lawyer good enough to turn down an offer of a place on the supreme court; a Catholic intellectual who dared to take on his church over abortion; a tireless campaigner against the death penalty; an orator who thrilled his party with one famous speech; and a politician who deeply disappointed it by twice backing away from running for president.\n\nIn 1984, as the keynote speaker at the Democratic national convention that nominated Walter Mondale to run for president, Cuomo had the nerve to mock Ronald Reagan\u2019s favourite image of America as \u201ca shining city on a hill\u201d. It was more a tale of two cities, he told a wildly cheering auditorium in San Francisco. There was another city, he said, where people \u201cstared from a distance at the shining towers\u201d of Reagan\u2019s rhetoric. In the places Reagan did not visit, Cuomo said, people could not afford a mortgage; they slept in the gutter. The Reagan Republicans, he said, had divided America \u201cbetween the lucky and the left-out, the royalty and the rabble\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, for all his talents and his sincere radicalism, Cuomo was an enigma. People could not understand why he twice turned down glowing opportunities to run for president as well as a clear offer of a place on the supreme court. No wonder journalists called him \u201cHamlet on the Hudson\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Cuomo during Columbus Day celebrations in New York in the 1980s. Photograph: Zuma/Rex\n\nPart of the explanation was his commitment to New York and a deep Catholic faith. Once when an engine in a plane he was flying in caught fire, he was imperturbable. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked a journalist flying with him. \u201cAre you not in a state of grace?\u201d Yet he infuriated the church with a speech at the great Catholic university in Indiana, Notre Dame, in which he equivocated like any 17th-century Jesuit confessor to royalty about the politics of abortion: \"God should not,\" he dared to say to that audience, \u201cbe made into a celestial party chairman.\" There was even talk of excommunication.\n\nThere were less saintly sides to that personality. He may have been, as New York\u2019s liberal mayor Bill de Blasio said after Cuomo died, \u201ca man of unwavering principle\u201d. But no one ever said he did not know how to look after himself. The bachelor politician Ed Koch never forgave the posters in a New York mayoral primary campaign in 1977, proclaiming \u201cVote for Cuomo, Not the Homo\u201d, though Cuomo always denied responsibility. President Clinton was embarrassed to be recorded comparing the New York governor to a mafioso and calling him, for good measure, \u201ca mean son of a bitch\u201d. He himself called politics \u201can ugly business\u201d.\n\nMario\u2019s parents, Andrea and Immaculata, had come from the province of Salerno in the Italian Mezzogiorno to the Queens neighbourhood of South Jamaica.\n\nIt was, as their son said later, \u201cItalian-black-German-Irish-Polish\u201d, a working-class part of New York, and Cuomo was a \u201clunch-bucket Democrat\u201d, who never forgot the bread-and-butter issues that mattered to New York\u2019s working class.\n\nHe also never forgot the opportunities New York and America had given him.\n\nHe went to St John's preparatory school, a high school run by the nearby St John\u2019s University. There he was so good at baseball that he was put under contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who sent him to one of their farm clubs in Brunswick, Georgia. He was doing well there when he was hit on the head by a fast ball. He was blind for a week, and had to give up baseball: it was the best thing that could have happened.\n\nHe went to St John\u2019s, where he was first in his class, and then to its law school, where he was supported by his wife, Matilda (nee Raffa), a teacher, after their marriage in 1952. Four years later he was called to the New York bar and worked as a clerk to the head of the New York state court of appeal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Cuomo at the 1984 Democratic convention in Washington DC. Photograph: Rex\n\nIn 1958 he went to work for a Brooklyn law firm and had no involvement in politics until he was over 30, when he was successful in helping a group of local homeowners who were threatened with losing their land to the ambitions of the New York \u201cmaster builder\u201d, Robert Moses, for the New York World's Fair of 1964-65. Again in 1972, Cuomo successfully mediated a dispute about a housing project on behalf of New York mayor John Lindsay, and in 1974 he undertook his first campaign, for lieutenant governor. He was elected to that post on his second attempt, in 1978, helped by another St John\u2019s alumnus and Catholic politician, the Democratic governor, Hugh Carey.\n\nIt was not until 1982 that Cuomo ran successfully for governor of the state, and won again in 1986 and 1990. At first he was brilliantly successful, so much so that he was re-elected to his second term with 65% of the vote. In 1983 he settled a prison riot at Sing Sing, known at the time as the Ossining correctional facility \u2013 in contrast to the bloodbath at Attica prison, in which 29 prisoners and 10 hostages had died, under his predecessor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971 \u2013 and raised money for education through huge bond issues.\n\nLater, life became more difficult because, as he candidly admitted at the start of his third term in 1991: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money.\" The paradox was that, though his presidential career prospects suffered because of his loyalty to New York state, he always did enough to keep his national prospects alive because it helped his poll standing in New York.\n\nIn October 1991 he said he was thinking of running for president, but two months later, with a plane waiting at the airport in Albany to take him to New Hampshire to file for the key presidential primary election there, he decided not to go. Two years later he turned down President Clinton\u2019s offer of the place on the supreme court that went to another New York liberal, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and in 1994, to his and everyone\u2019s else\u2019s surprise, he was defeated for re-election by the relatively unknown Republican, George Pataki.\n\nIn the end, when asked by the New York Times what he would like to have said in his obituary he replied: \u201cI tried.\" They used to say that you couldn\u2019t be president of the United States if your surname ended in a vowel. But it was Barack Obama, not Mario Cuomo, who first proved that wrong. In truth he did not try hard enough to be president.\n\nHe is survived by Matilda, his daughters, Margaret, Maria and Madeline, and his sons, Christopher and Andrew. His death came on the day that Andrew was inaugurated for a second term as governor of New York.\n\n\u2022 Mario Matthew Cuomo, politician, born 15 June 1932; died 1 January 2015", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Godfrey Hodgson", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2012-09-06": [{"author": "On Thursday afternoon the fate of the entire 17-member eurozone rested on the shoulders of one man: Mario Draghi. That such an assertion can be made \u2013 without the umistakable smack of hyperbole \u2013 surely shows what trouble the euro project is now in. Because no matter how innovative or bold Mr Draghi's response \u2013 and it was undoubtedly both \u2013 the success or failure of a currency, a single market, and a political project should never be in the gift of an unelected central banker and his equally unelected colleagues.\n\nYet throughout the panic and denial and firefighting of the past couple of years, two major trends in European policy-making are observable: first, economic power in the continent has shifted away from national governments and towards the European Central Bank; second, and this is surely related, European politicians and policymakers have omitted to make the case for why the euro should exist at all. Instead they assert that the euro must continue \u2013 \"whatever it takes\", as Mr Draghi said this summer \u2013 or they conflate austerity with the euro with Europe, as Angela Merkel repeatedly does. The result is that what has to be a grand, cross-national political project if it is to survive at all is no such thing; it is becoming ever more an elite project that is only able to endure at the costs of those lower down in society, especially in southern Europe. For those at the top: officially granted liquidity. For those at the bottom: unnegotiable austerity.\n\nThe announcement by Mr Draghi fits neatly into this pattern. The new plan to rescue the euro sounds complicated, but it really boils down to one thing: a guarantee that nations struggling to raise funds from financial markets will be helped out by the ECB. The scheme even has a name: outright monetary transactions, or OMT, or, as wags dubbed it, on my tab \u2013 since that is effectively what Mr Draghi is now offering the rest of the euro club, to put the mother of all credit cards behind the bar. The net result will be to wreck the ECB's balance sheet, but along the way there will also be strict austerity conditions. Before digging into the problems with this latest solution, one big acknowledgment must be made: this is about as big a step as the ECB could have taken.\n\nThe previous boss of Frankfurt, Jean-Claude Trichet, would barely have dreamed up such a scheme, let alone pushed it through. It is clear too that Germany has been forced to go along with this: it was as good as admitted that the Bundesbank opposed this scheme \u2013 a rather crucial no vote, given that it is the Germans who will have to act as paymasters-in-chief. In his imaginativeness and political astuteness, Mr Draghi has lived up to his side of the bargain to do \"whatever it takes\". Yet the plan, in its insistence on austerity conditions, is wrong-headed and, in total, not enough. The debt problems for Spain and Italy have worsened partly as a result of their economies slowing down: so strong-arming them into making ever more spending cuts will just intensify the death spiral. If you want a parallel, just look at George Osborne's double-dip recession, created with a very similar mix of \"fiscal conservatism and monetary activism\". As the chancellor has found, even after Mervyn King has thrown the best part of \u00a3400bn at the economy, a recovery can't be rustled up to order. Nor can spending cuts: just ask Madrid, which is having to bail out stricken provinces left, right and centre.\n\nThis argument should remind us of just how multifaceted the eurozone's problems are. There is the huge and pressing issue of the financing of Spanish and Italian government (and bank) debt; which Mr Draghi has tried to sort out.

The attacking midfielder\u2019s career has stalled at Bayern Munich, where he has made only 12 appearances this season, and he is keen on a move away from the Allianz Arena despite the impending arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as Pep Guardiola\u2019s replacement.\n\nBayern want almost \u00a330m for the player they signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2013 but Liverpool hope a deal can be agreed for \u00a315m-\u00a320m. That valuation is based on G\u00f6tze having only 12 months remaining on his Bayern contract at the end of this season and his reluctance to sign an extension.\n\nArsenal are also interested in the player who scored Germany\u2019s winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final but the attraction of working with Klopp for a second time has given Liverpool a significant advantage. G\u00f6tze enjoyed the finest period of his career for Klopp at Dortmund, scoring 22 goals in 83 Bundesliga appearances and playing a key role in the club\u2019s two Bundesliga titles, one German Cup success and progress to the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nThe combination of a fresh start away from Bayern plus renewing acquaintances with Klopp is believed to appeal to the Germany international, who has found opportunities limited under Guardiola and struggled with injuries during his time in Bavaria. The change of manager at Bayern this summer has not altered the player\u2019s opinion.\n\nBorussia Dortmund feel hurt by Mario G\u00f6tze transfer to Bayern Munich Read more\n\nKlopp knows his former Dortmund charge is ideally suited to the gegenpressing style he wants at Anfield and is using his contacts in Germany for the first summer transfer window of his Anfield reign. The Liverpool manager played an influential role in persuading the Cameroon international defender Jo\u00ebl Matip to leave Schalke for Merseyside when his contract expires at the Bundesliga club this summer. Liverpool have also signed the highly rated Red Star Belgrade playmaker Marko Grujic for next season although, at 19 years of age, the \u00a35.1m recruit will need time to adapt to the Premier League.\n\nG\u00f6tze\u2019s arrival would represent a far bigger coup for Liverpool and Klopp, however, despite his recent difficulties with the Bundesliga champions.

eurozone economy, with reports suggesting it could total more than \u20ac1tn.\n\nThe eagerly expected quantitative easing programme, which will come two-and-a-half years after ECB president Mario Draghi said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the euro, looks to have cleared all hurdles despite strong opposition from Germany.\n\nSpeculation over the details reached fever pitch in recent days, and Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi said on Wednesday the ECB could \u201chelp Europe give a message of a new economic direction\u201d. Reports out of Frankfurt on the same day suggested that the ECB is considering a sovereign bond buying programme of \u20ac50bn a month starting in March, to run through 2016, which would come to \u20ac1.1tn. This is far more than markets had been expecting, although it was also reported that no formal decision had been taken and the numbers could still change. Draghi is due to announce the unprecedented measures at a press conference at ECB headquarters in Frankfurt at 1.30pm UK time.\n\nThere are concerns, however, that it is too little, too late. Growth in the 19-nation eurozone has been lacklustre, and the currency bloc slipped into deflation in December, when prices fell by 0.2%, the first annual decline for five years.\n\nNick Kounis at ABN Amro said: \u201cWe think that the QE programme needs to be towards the upper end of the range to impress financial markets, and this looks increasingly likely. As well as government bonds, other securities, such as agency debt and corporate bonds could well be included.\u201d\n\nDraghi and his colleagues on the ECB governing council have been discussing the possibility of pumping money into the eurozone banking system, by acquiring government debt from financial institutions, since the summer. But the Bundesbank and the German government have opposed the plans, amid worries that its citizens would be left nursing other countries\u2019 debts.\n\nMarkets are curious to see what concessions had to be made to get the Germans on board, or \u201ceven if they are on board, particularly given the size of the package that is being reported,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.\n\n\u201cIf the decision is not unanimous, which seems likely given the reported size of the package, then the market should be prepared for legal challenges in the German courts, and

launched what City experts called a \u201cshock and awe\u201d plan to pump \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3830bn) into the eurozone in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the single currency bloc sliding into an intractable slump.\n\nIn the teeth of fierce political resistance from Germany, ECB president Mario Draghi said he would inject \u20ac60bn of new money into financial markets every month until at least September 2016.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based bank will use electronically created money to buy the bonds of eurozone governments \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 to try to boost confidence, push up inflation and drive down the value of the single currency, helping to increase exports and kickstart growth.\n\nNancy Curtin, chief investment officer of the City firm Close Brothers, said: \u201cThe eurozone was in need of shock and awe tactics from the ECB to combat the prospect of a prolonged period of deflation, and Draghi has finally delivered on his promise to do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe euro fell to $1.14 against the dollar after the announcement \u2013 its lowest level for 11 years, and well below the $1.17 exchange rate at which the single currency was launched. British holidaymakers planning a spring break on the continent also received a fillip, as the euro lost more than 1% of its value against the pound, with a euro now worth just 75p.\n\nThe \u20ac60bn-a-month price tag for the QE programme, which will start in March, was larger than many in financial markets had expected, and underlined Draghi\u2019s determination to hold the 19-member currency zone together. The banker, nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d by traders, promised QE would continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d.\n\nThe ECB is meant to keep inflation below, but close to, its target level of 2% \u2013 but prices have been rising at less than half that pace for the past year, against a background of plunging oil prices and anaemic growth. With average prices in the shops already falling across the single currency area, the ECB hopes to avoid the threat of a deflationary spiral, in which consumers and businesses slash spending while they wait for prices to fall further, dragging the economy into a recession.\n\nSpeaking in Frankfurt Draghi said: \u201cThe risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside, but should have diminished after today\u2019s monetary policy decisions and the continued fall in oil prices over recent weeks.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited launch of QE will infuriate Berlin, which views the policy as akin to a bailout for free-spending governments such as Greece, and fears that it could allow inflation to get out of control. A headline on the website of the newspaper Bild after the announcement read: \u201cECB takes billions of debt off ailing euro states: What happens to my money now?\u201d\n\nDraghi said the decision of the ECB\u2019s governing council was made with \u201cso large a majority that no vote was necessary\u201d, but that suggested that the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, had stuck by his longstanding opposition to QE.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said: \u201cIt does not surprise me that there is a contentious debate within the ECB. The world is already well supplied with liquidity. Regardless of what the ECB does, it should not obscure the fact that the real growth impulses must come from conditions set by the politicians.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers in the US and the UK have used QE to restore confidence and unblock financial markets since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009, but the ECB had been reluctant to follow suit in the face of German opposition and fears that it could unleash inflation.\n\nA slowdown in the eurozone, Britain\u2019s major export market, is one of the key risks to UK economic recovery.\n\nGeorge Osborne said: \u201cThe fact that the ECB had to take this drastic action shows the European economy is much weaker than the UK economy and it\u2019s also a warning to Britain of the risks that lie ahead if we were to abandon our long term economic plan.\u201d\n\nJohn Cridland, director general of the CBI, welcomed Draghi\u2019s move: \u201cAt the moment, flagging eurozone economies are dragging on UK and world growth. Quantitative easing will give the Eurozone recovery a much-needed boost, which should also have a positive economic effect in the UK.\u201d\n\nChristine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, which cut its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy last week, said QE should \u201chelp lower borrowing costs across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation\u201d.\n\nThe \u20ac60bn-a-month total for the QE programme includes the purchase of private sector assets that the ECB had already begun, to try to unlock credit markets.\n\nDraghi echoed Merkel\u2019s call for national governments to take their own steps to kickstart growth, stressing that QE alone would not repair the eurozone economy. \u201cWhat monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth, but for growth to pick up you need investment, for investment you need confidence, and for confidence you need structural reforms.\u201d\n\nSony Kapoor, of the thinktank Re-Define, called on eurozone governments to respond by relaxing austerity policies and increasing public spending, to create demand and restore economic growth.\n\n\u201cToday the ECB has finally arrived as a truly \u2018European\u2019 Central Bank. It has acted against political opposition to deliver what is by most measures an ambitious programme of quantitative easing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ECB has finally, if belatedly, done its part. Now it\u2019s time for the eurozone to relax the fiscal constraint.\n\nDraghi ridiculed the doomsayers predicting that hyperinflation would eventually result from QE, saying that hawks had repeatedly warned about inflation taking off each time the ECB had cut interest rates \u2013 yet inflation remained very low. He said there should be a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d on such warnings.\n\nThe ECB had already announced, in a statement earlier on Thursday, that it would leave its main interest rate unchanged at 0.05%.\n\nIn a concession to German reservations, Draghi promised that national central banks would bear much of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d between member countries. Some analysts fear that could dent the effectiveness of the policy.\n\nIn an aside that will be heard loud and clear in Athens, Draghi also warned: \u201cSome additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme.\u201d\n\nThat could allow the ECB to exclude Greek bonds from QE if, for example, the populist Syriza party wins Sunday\u2019s general election and ditches the austerity programme imposed by its creditors.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Heather Stewart", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], [{"author": "Two and a half years have passed since Mario Draghi promised to do \u201cwhat it takes\u201d to save the euro. But it took until Thursday for him to get around to doing what his counterparts in Washington, London and Tokyo did long ago \u2013 and set the printing presses whirring in the battle against economic depression.\n\nThe president of the European Central Bank is, even though such a technocrat would deny it, an accomplished politician. It\u2019s just as well: he has to be. At his press conference, the upbeat Italian set out a large, if heavily rule-bound, bond-buying scheme which represented the best that he could wring out of the eurozone\u2019s sclerotic architecture of economic governance.\n\nThe headline commitment, to purchase \u20ac60bn in assets with made-up money each month, cheered the markets because it was \u20ac10bn more than the \u20ac50bn that had been artfully trailed. The successful spin could unravel \u2013 especially if it emerges that German resistance to starting the scheme at this moment was fierce. \u201cAdditional eligibility criteria\u201d for countries in receipt of IMF help confirmed the lack of any spirit of solidarity towards Greece, days ahead of that country\u2019s plebiscite on years of Euro-austerity. Arcane, and ultimately second order, negotiations about how losses for purely hypothetical defaults by other states might be shared across the continent went to the wire.\n\nBut from this haggling Mr Draghi rescued a tolerable if unsatisfactory fudge, and on two other details that could have turned devilish, he notched up victories. He announced the unanimous recognition by his board, which includes two German members, that the sort of quantitative easing he is embarking on is a legitimate tool of the trade. A settled ECB view that the Draghi plan rests on proper authority is useful to have in the face of ongoing legal arguments, which resonate in Berlin, about the bank going beyond its powers. His second win was to avoid getting ensnared in an arbitrary time limit, announcing that bond buying would continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d, which \u2013 when translated from central bank jargon \u2013 means for as long as it takes.\n\nBut as long as it takes to do what? The immediate, and the only explicit, objective is to restore consumer prices, which are now actually sinking, to annual growth of something approaching 2%. This matters because of the desperate need to shrug off the wider European stagnation, which deflation both symbolises and threatens to intensify. Unchecked it will swell the real value of debts, weighing down mortgaged families and the businesses that the eurozone desperately needs to invest. Bond buying will not on its own guarantee any recovery in economic spirits, but Europe has reached a pass where a continuing failure to act would have virtually guaranteed that the mood would not lift.\n\nThere are myriad theories about exactly how QE works \u2013 from inspiring workers to demand a pay rise, to enticing financiers to lend to companies instead of just governments \u2013 most of them dubious. Many of the Fed\u2019s freshly minted QE dollars have ended up swelling New York hedge funds, while the wand waved by the Bank of England has worked more magic in the South Kensington property market than anywhere else. But however perverse it may be to reward the speculating classes who had such a hand in the original crisis, it is preferable to sitting idly by while purchasing power shrivels away. Until , the record of the ECB was worse than passivity \u2013 it has spent most of the past two years contracting its balance sheet, and with it the real value of the money in circulation. And as the US and the UK economies have falteringly chugged back to life, the eurozone has remain utterly stalled.\n\nA powerful case can be made that it would not only be fairer but more expansionary too if instead of embracing a conventional QE programme, the ECB had been more creative \u2013 and lent straight to expanding employers, directly bank-rolled investment in public infrastructure, or simply credited cash into regular citizens\u2019 accounts. Europe, however, is not in imaginative mood. It currently needs all the energy it can muster just to survive.

Not from tyranny, persecution or oppression. But from truth. We\u2019re fighting for our right to lie. From this day on, the third day of July will no longer be remembered as an the festival of Saint Heliodorus of Altino but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not vanish without a lie. We will lie on. We will lie. Speaking of which. Here is today\u2019s fresh, pile of transfer boo-do.\n\nOver in Manchester United, Louis van Gaal has just put the phone down and is feeling a bit sheepish. He has been trying to get through to Seamus Coleman all week but he keeps getting his voicemail. At first, Louis was worried that he had written the number down wrong, then he worried that Seamus had blocked his calls, then he worried about whether or not the last voicemail he left was a bit too forward. \u201cMy name is Louis,\u201d he said \u201cusually I don\u2019t do this but I see you and me Seamus. Louis will give you no worries, Louis got million stories about these players that Louis laughed at when they was boring. Louis gone fill your pockets, Louis gone move your mama out of Donegal inside the gigantic mansion like Louis promised, Louis just want your trust and loyalty. Avoiding Louis? It\u2019s not so easy, Louis at these functions accordingly. Louis don\u2019t slack a minute, Louis work harder, Louis gone call you, Louis don\u2019t mind cause at the end of the day you\u2019ll pursue me. Louis go get it, Louis not timid, Louis up front, Louis got paper work on top of paper work, I want you to know that Louis got you. All your life I watched you and now I want you to sign this contract if that\u2019s possible.\u201d With the worrying out of the way, Louis made himself a cup of green tea to go with the financier he bought earlier that day from his local bakery and wondered how he would break the news to Jonny Evans that he is moving to Everton.\n\nLouis is the only one to be wondering these days, Steve McClaren has been too. Steve has mostly been musing about the fate of Greece and the knock-on effect on the Eurozone, as well as what impact the endorsing of the yes vote by the former conservative leader Costas Karamanlis will have, but he has been wondering about other things too. What was his favourite incarnation of the Sugarbabes, would he look good with an ice-cream cone on his face like Gucci\u2019s and what is the best way to bring stability to Newcastle. In case you haven\u2019t noticed it, dear Mill readers, over the last few years, Newcastle have been more all over the place than a teenager\u2019s emotions. But sweat not, sweet fans of Newcastle, Steve is tapping the right side of his nose with his right index finger and is flashing his freshly pained grill. He knows how to solve this problem, he knows what needs to be done. He is going to bring in a superstar, the type of buy that will have the fans sleeping outside the club shop for days just to get his name printed on their jersey; the type of buy that will have those not sleeping outside the club shop, sleeping outside the local tattoo parlour to get his name emblazoned just above where they have the picture of their kids; the type of buy that will bring a professionalism to the side and make the rest of players up their game and work ten times harder. Who could that buy be? Well Mario Balotelli, of course.\n\nBack to Everton for a moment. If you hear them laughing hysterically, it has nothing to do with them remembering their favourite Woody Allen joke, you know the one when he says he asked his mother where babies came from and she thought he said \u201crabies\u201d. She said you get them from being bitten by a dog. The next week, a woman on his block gave birth to triplets and he thought she\u2019d been bitten by a great dane. No, it has nothing to do with that at all and more to do with the call they have just got from Tottenham. The London lads were very polite and prim. They asked how Everton were doing and how the mother was and whether she had recovered from her fall and they did not forget to mention that they had enjoyed the sister\u2019s ballet recital immensely. With the pleasantries out of the way, they soon got down to business. We\u2019re interested in James McCarthy, they said. At this point, Everton knew this call was going nowhere but decided to reciprocate the politeness afforded to them and so they let Spurs natter on. We\u2019re interested in James McCarthy, they repeated, and we are willing to offer you Aaron Lennon or Younes Kaboul in return. It was at this point, Everton could hold it in no more and the laughter burst forth like the morning.\n\nElsewhere, David de Gea ... Real ... zzz ...\n\nAntonio R\u00fcdiger has been up all night working, not on his ball control, or his positioning, or his heading, but on his art. You might not know this but R\u00fcdiger is a big fan of the painted word.

Of course the cast are all blessed with arcane powers and their attendance at the school is no coincidence.\n\nAs with the fantastic Persona 4 Golden, social activities between missions are as important as combat and exploration.

Inspired by the events of the 1992\u201396 siege of Sarajevo, its rerelease is of note because, unusually, it recreates the experience from a civilian rather than military perspective.

This not only introduces new interactions and needs but changes the tone of proceedings as lone children or parent-child partnerships join the group.\n\nGameplay alternates between daytime hideout maintenance and risky scavenging raids at night, with limited time in each cycle, with dwindling resources resulting in a struggle to survive. It is a remarkable work, turning video game power fantasies on their head and creating a compelling experience aimed at a wide audience. AR\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A charming title\u2019: Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.\n\nSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\n\n(Wii U, Nintendo, cert: 3)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nA rare title rightly receives another outing in the form of Super Mario RPG, which was never released in Europe. It came out late in the Super Nintendo\u2019s life and almost coincided with the N64\u2019s launch. As a result, it never got the recognition it deserved, something that may be corrected with the rerelease on Wii U, for this is a wonderfully entertaining adventure.\n\nSuper Mario RPG was a collaboration between Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Final Fantasy developer Square. Instead of jumping on enemies, Mario took part in turn-based battles to defeat foes. The combat, then, is a bit archaic by today\u2019s standards and the plot, which involves a giant sword trying to conquer the mushroom kingdom, is forgettable. Yet this is a charming title, with impressive isometric visuals for the period, an excellent soundtrack and hilarious, self-mocking dialogue that has become standard in subsequent Mario RPGs. It\u2019s been bettered since, of course, but Super Mario RPG is a piece of history that\u2019s well worth a download and deserving of its day in the sun.

Despite being dropped by the manager, Ronald Koeman, in January amid speculation of a move to Old Trafford and going four months without a goal, the 24-year-old ended the campaign as the team\u2019s leading scorer with 15 goals in all competitions.\n\nThe Senegal international is of interest to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who is in the market for a forward who suits his high-intensity pressing game at Liverpool and had hoped to sign G\u00f6tze from Bayern Munich for a fee of around \u00a320m.\n\nLiverpool had been confident of a deal for the World Cup winner before he changed agents and declared this week that he intended to fight for his place at Bayern under their new coach, Carlo Ancelotti.

The news cemented market expectations that the ECB would use its meeting next week to inject fresh cash into the single currency bloc and to cut a key interest rate further into negative territory.\n\nCentral bankers on the defensive as weird policy becomes even weirder Read more\n\nHeadline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January, according to an early estimate from statistics office Eurostat. That contrasted with forecasts for a reading of zero in a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nLow energy prices were the main factor behind the drop, but price pressures in other areas of the economy played a part. There was also a drop in core inflation \u2013 taken as a guide to underlying price \u2013 adding to signs that low inflation was becoming more entrenched as eurozone economies battled with sluggish global demand from a fresh slowdown and the lingering impact of the last financial crisis.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of unprocessed food and energy, fell more than expected to 0.8% from 1% in January and was its lowest since April last year.\n\nEconomists said the inflation numbers raised questions over the firepower of central banks to revive growth and prices. Deflation concerns central bank policymakers because it can lead to consumers delaying spending in the anticipation of good becoming cheaper, creating a cycle of diminishing demand that hits economic growth.\n\nThis year will be the fourth year of inflation undershooting the ECB\u2019s target of close to 2%, said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at French banking group Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. There were no limits to the ECB\u2019s willingness \u201cbut clear limits to its effectiveness\u201d, he said. \u201cDespite its best efforts, the ECB\u2019s challenge to break the backbone of lowflation remains a tall order. Looking set to miss its target for a fourth year this year, we expect it to miss it for another four years, at least, without the help of more substantial economic reform. That won\u2019t stop the ECB from doing what it must according to its self-imposed target, but with markets increasingly unconvinced, we are approaching the \u2018effective\u2019 limit of the ECB\u2019s tools.\u201d\n\nThe inflation figures follow warnings from the IMF and the OECD that governments cannot rely on low interest rates and money-printing programmes to shore up growth. A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of countries ended with a similar statement that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But the policymakers failed to come up with a concrete plan of how they might revive a sluggish world economy.\n\nThe Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used his speech at the Shanghai meeting to insist central bankers still had ammunition left to boost growth. But he too argued for more help from governments.\n\n\n\nThis week marks seven years of UK interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate further but has ruled out following the trend seen in other countries for negative rates, where depositors are effectively charged for parking their money. The Bank of Japan recently joined the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, amid signs of a strongly growing US economy. But a string of poor economic figures since then raised doubts about any future rate-rises and even prompted some economists to speculate the move could be reversed.\n\nThe ECB meets again next week to decide its next move and its chief, Mario Draghi, has already indicated the central bank will announce moves to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone. Economists expect the Frankfurt-based body to expand its quantitative easing programme \u2013 where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u2013 and to further cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. Another reduction in the deposit rate means it would be charging banks more to hold their money overnight.\n\n\n\nThe weak core inflation figure \u201cpretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing\u201d at next week\u2019s meeting, said Teunis Brosens at ING bank. \u201cThe weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u2018inflate away\u2019 their debt burden by increasing nominal wages,\u201d Brosens said.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.4, "magnitude": 0.4}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Katie Allen", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1},

If he continues with the approach he\u2019s had in this first week then he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nBalotelli\u2019s first spell at Milan was relatively successful, with a respectable scoring rate, although there were some misdemeanours. He lost his temper in front of the cameras after one performance was criticised by Italian television pundits, telling his interviewers that they did not understand football and throwing his microphone down.\n\nHe was also booked for making a vulgar gesture at Cagliari supporters, served two three-match bans and was caught smoking in the toilet of a train by a ticket collector.\n\nHowever, these incidents paled in comparison to some of his antics at Manchester City earlier in his career, such as when he and some friends famously let off fireworks in his bathroom, leading to his house being set on fire.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.2, "magnitude": 0.2}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Guardian Sport", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON",

plans to leave the EU.\n\nHe told the European parliament\u2019s committee on economic and monetary affairs that the UK should address the uncertainty over how Brexit will play out.\n\nDraghi said Britain would bear the brunt of the economic damage if Brexit created a UK economy with lower migration and weaker growth in trade and investment.\n\nHe told MEPs: \u201cWe are looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this.\u201d\n\nThe ECB president said it was not yet possible to say whether Brexit would cost jobs in the City or mean that London-based banks lost their passporting rights to offer services across the EU.\n\n\n\nAsked about the consequences of the vote to leave the EU, Draghi said the only answer to many questions was \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason we don\u2019t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of the negotiations will be and how long they will last. It\u2019s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty,\u201d he said.\n\nDraghi predicted that Brexit would raise about questions about eurozone sovereignty. Last year, the ECB lost a legal fight to have the clearing of euro-denominated securities moved from London to the eurozone, and Draghi suggested that legislators might want to consider changing the law.\n\n\u201cIf, in the long run, the risk of a less open UK economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialise, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition, and thus, productivity and potential output,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch developments would first and foremost weigh on the UKeconomy.\u201d\n\nBank of England prepares to protect City firms from hard Brexit Read more\n\nAt the weekend, it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had held talks with senior City figures about negotiating a \u201ctransitional arrangement\u201d to protect financial companies from the dangers of suddenly losing full membership of the single market.\n\nParesh Davdra, the chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, said central bankers were becoming frustrated that elected politicians were not pulling their weight.\n\n\u201cDraghi\u2019s comments likely reflect a frustration that Carney will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfil certain roles that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable,\u201d Davdra said.\n\n\u201cDraghi\u2018s comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, in his call for the prime minister, Theresa May, to share more about the Brexit strategy, days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the case of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Graeme Wearden", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON",

five-year low of 0.3%.\n\nPressure on the European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, to head off the threat of falling prices intensified as annual inflation in August fell from 0.4% in July, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency. Separate figures showed the economic woes of the region continued to take their toll on workers, with the unemployment rate for July unchanged at 11.5%.\n\nBoth numbers had been forecast by economists, who said the inflation numbers were likely to concern the ECB, but not push it into any immediate measures.\n\n\"The very low eurozone inflation reading for August reinforces pressure on the ECB to consider further monetary stimulus on top of what is already in the pipeline,\" said Martin van Vliet, of ING. \"With inflation inching towards zero, the cushion against deflation is getting smaller and smaller.\"\n\nExperts noted that the August fall was driven by a drop in volatile energy prices and there was some downward pressure from food prices, also liable to big swings. But even the core inflation rate, which strips out the more volatile goods, was cause for concern, said Alasdair Cavalla at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. It rose to 0.9% from 0.8%, which was \"better, but still far short of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2.0%,\" Cavalla said.\n\n\"The weakness of demand means that core inflation is also at risk of falling. The probability of Europe falling into a deflation trap, where consumers postpone spending to wait for lower prices and debts rise in real terms, rises each time inflation falls.\"\n\nFinding itself up against high unemployment, worryingly low inflation, lacklustre growth and rising political tensions over austerity within many member states' governments, the ECB has called on political leaders to play a greater role in shoring up the eurozone. Draghi used a speech to the US Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month to call for more growth-friendly policies.

The European Central Bank caught the financial markets totally unawares when it cut its key interest rate to 0.25% and there was an instant response. The euro - perilously overvalued on the foreign exchanges - fell like a stone.\n\nDraghi clearly had to overcome resistance from the ECB council, with some members seeking to delay any easing of policy to a later date. This would have been a mistake. The latest figures show the euro area flirting dangerously with deflation, with prices rising at an annual rate of just 0.7%. Try as he might to dispel the idea, the euro area today is starting to look worryingly like Japan in the early 1990s. Credit flows have dried up, a double dip recession has left oodles of spare capacity, and there is plenty of deflationary pressure coming down the pipeline, from the falling cost of food to lower prices for manufactured goods.\n\nDeflation is already a reality for the troubled countries on the fringes of monetary union, with the real and present danger of the core following before too long. So Draghi was quite right to face down the Bundesbank and insist on immediate action.\n\nThe fall in the value of the euro will - if sustained - help avert the threat of deflation by increasing the cost of imports. Draghi, therefore, missed a trick when he said the value of the single currency had not been discussed at the ECB's council meeting. This was the opportunity to talk down the euro, getting the maximum out of the cut in borrowing costs.\n\nThe ECB president also invited derision by saying that the eurozone (unemployment 12.2%, trend rate of growth 1% at best, a broken banking system) had the best economic fundamentals in the world. In truth, deflation threatens to trigger a new phase of the eurozone crisis, because falling prices plus weak growth equals unsustainable debt.

eurozone as soon as March.\n\n\n\nThe ECB left interest rates on hold at its latest policy meeting but its president, Mario Draghi, acknowledged growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as he said the central bank would review its policy in March \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting.\n\n\n\nLondon\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart, Mark Carney, this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened.\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn.\n\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close.\n\nStock market rally peters out amid continued turmoil Read more\n\nIn December, the ECB expanded its quantitative easing programme - where the bank pumps money into the financial system by acquiring bonds \u2013 and trimmed a deposit rate paid on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nBut the action was deemed too modest by market players at the time. Many had been expecting more aggressive moves following signals from Draghi that he was serious about lifting eurozone inflation out of the doldrums.\n\nReferring to a tumultuous start to the year on global markets, which has seen trillions of dollars wiped off the value of world shares and a 40% drop in oil prices since the last ECB policy meeting, Draghi used a news conference on Thursday to defend December\u2019s moves as entirely appropriate at the time.\n\nHe told reporters: \u201cAs we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies\u2019 growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy every meaningful measure, today's elites are gods. This should make us angry | Jeff Sparrow Read more\n\nOn currency markets, the euro weakened to a two-week low against the dollar on the prospect of more monetary policy easing from the ECB as soon as March. Draghi\u2019s comments also moved oil prices: Brent crude was up more than 6% from the previous session at $29.60 per barrel.\n\nThe price had fallen below $28 this week as worries about oversupply intensified on the prospect of fresh supply from Iran after the lifting of sanctions last week. Analysts cautioned that Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, but they would need to be followed with real action.\n\n\u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG.\n\n\u201cAll in all, it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JPMorgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d\n\nRanko Berich, head of market analysis at the foreign exchange company Monex Europe, said any euphoria on the back of promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting and that it remained unclear if the ECB was willing to commit to the sort of \u201cmassive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes\u201d seen from the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cAs commodity prices fall and base effects from the euro fade, deflation will again threaten the eurozone and inflation expectations could begin to fall apart. If this is how 2016 plays out, vague promises will no longer be enough to keep the economy on track and the ECB will be forced to put its money where Draghi\u2019s mouth is,\u201d Berich said.\n\n",

growth in the eurozone.\n\nThe ECB president, Mario Draghi, said his staff would \u201ccontinue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely\u201d but gave no clues as to what the bank might do.\n\nFinancial markets had not expected any action from the ECB but saw Draghi\u2019s comment that the bank had a \u201creadiness, willingness and ability\u201d to act as a clear sign that further stimulus was on the way.\n\nThe ECB president said over the coming months his organisation would be in a better position to assess the state of the eurozone economy and the impact of Brexit on growth and inflation.\n\nDraghi added that, if warranted, the ECB would use all the \u201cinstruments available within its mandate\u201d, leaving open the possibility of fresh cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its quantitative easing (QE) programme.\n\nFollowing the example of the Bank of England, the ECB made no changes to policy at the first meeting of its governing council since the UK\u2019s referendum, leaving interest rates unchanged and deciding to continue to buy \u20ac80bn (\u00a367bn) of assets a month under its QE programme.\n\nMarc Ostwald, strategist at ADM investor services, said Draghi had given a \u201cmasterclass in stonewalling\u201d at a press conference to explain the ECB\u2019s lack of action.\n\n\u201cOverall, Draghi appeared to be very determined to say nothing of any significance. To be fair, he and the rest of the council have stressed for a number of months that the existing package of policy measures must be given time to work, and that an assessment of whether there might be a need to do more would not happen before the September meeting and staff forecast update,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThus the message was that the ECB is \u2018ready, willing and able\u2019 to act \u2018if needed\u2019, while stressing that risks are to the downside of their forecasts, to underline a dovish bias.\u201d\n\nIan Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the eurozone. With post-Brexit evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting before extending its QE timetable.\n\n\n\n\u201cInflation remains far below the ECB\u2019s target of 2% and while headline inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in the new ECB staff forecasts.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-06-21": [{"author": "The two most powerful central bankers have warned that they are on high alert for financial and economic fallout from the EU referendum, amid signs that the result of Thursday\u2019s vote still hangs in the balance.\n\nOn a day that saw Monday\u2019s big rises in shares and the pound halted by polls showing the race too close to call, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said he was prepared to use every available tool to protect the eurozone if the UK decides to leave.\n\nDraghi said: \u201cWe will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK\u2019s EU referendum.\u201d\n\nJanet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, told Congress that in a world marked by sluggish growth, weak inflation and low interest rates investors could quickly become more risk averse.\n\n\u201cOne development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIt could launch a period of uncertainty [with] negative economic consequences for the UK spilling over into Europe.\u201d\n\nAs the referendum campaign reached its closing stages, the FTSE 100 marked time \u2013 closing 23 points higher at 6,227.

This prompted a response from Norman Lamont, who was running the Treasury on Black Wednesday 24 years ago. He said: \u201cThe devaluation of sterling in September 1992 didn\u2019t do the UK economy any harm, far from it. Nor would a fall in the pound this time necessarily be a disaster. The key difference between now and 1992 is that today the pound is floating and any devaluation could be self-correcting and temporary.\u201d\n\nBut other international economists backed Soros\u2019s view that there would be serious market turmoil in the event of a vote to leave.\n\nLarry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, wrote in a blogpost: \u201cA Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15% off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, said the EU referendum could shift investor sentiment.

At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave,\u201d he said.\n\nNouriel Roubini, the economist nicknamed Dr Doom after accurately predicting the 2008 crisis, supported David Cameron\u2019s view that Brexit would leave Britons worse off.\n\n\u201cBrexit could stall the UK economy and tip it into a recession as the shock to business and consumer confidence could be severe,\u201d said Roubini, who teaches at New York University\u2019s Stern school of business.\n\n\n\nWhile giving evidence to the European parliament, Draghi said: \u201cWe monitor all economic, political and legal developments so we can assess and manage the ensuing risks. We have existing swap lines with other central banks. The agreements are there, we want to make sure they are useable, active and adequate.\n\n\u201cThe event will have short and long-term effects. It is hard to say what sort of action we would take in each contingency.\u201d\n\nBut Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Washington-based thinktank, the Center for Economic Policy Research, said: \u201cThere is a Mafia-like quality to the threats emanating from EU officials, who are acknowledged to be contemplating how much punishment they can mete out to the UK if the people should dare to vote the wrong way.\u201d\n\nHe added that the message was: \u201cVote remain and nobody gets hurt.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-12-08": [{"author": "Nintendo\u2019s legendary platformer runs and jumps on to smartphones on 15 December, but will it spring to new heights or plumb the depths?\n\nQuirky social app Miitomo wasn\u2019t the \u201cproper\u201d game fans were looking for when Nintendo announced its long-anticipated move into smartphone games. Super Mario Run almost certainly is that game though.\n\nUnveiled at Apple\u2019s WWDC event in June, it will be an iOS exclusive when it launches on 15 December, although an Android port is expected to follow in 2017.\n\nIn November, Nintendo revealed the launch date and confirmed that Super Mario Run will be free to download and try, with a single $9.99 in-app purchase (likely \u00a37.99 in the UK) unlocking the rest of the game.\n\nThat month, Nintendo also gathered journalists for a hands-on demonstration of its first iPhone game, with one line in particular repeated several times by the company\u2019s reps: \u201cA true Mario platformer that you can play entirely with one hand.\u201d\n\nThe messaging around Super Mario Run isn\u2019t a surprise, with Nintendo hoping to scotch two fears for fans: first, that the classic Super Mario gameplay will be dumbed down for a massively mainstream mobile audience, and second that the translation from joypads to touchscreens will be botched.\n\nBased on the almost-finished code, it\u2019s looking good on both fronts.\n\nFrom the finely tuned jumping mechanic to the level design, Super Mario Run feels like a proper (and new) Mario game, with plenty of nods back to earlier games for hardcore fans, but a well-crafted one-tap control system to suit its new medium.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Mario Run\u2019s World Tour levels.\n\nThere are three main parts to Super Mario Run: its main World Tour mode; its Toad Rally challenge mode; and the Kingdom Builder mode that sits between the other two. The free download will let you play the game\u2019s first three levels in both World Tour and Toad Rally modes, as well as a 20-second demo of the fourth.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve paid your \u00a37.99 to unlock the full game, there are no more in-app purchases. While spending virtual coins is a key part of the game, they\u2019re only earned by playing, not by paying.\n\nTaking the Tour\n\nSuper Mario Run is a blend of traditional Mario platformers and modern endless-runners. Mario automatically runs from left to right and clambers over small obstacles, while you tap lightly for a little jump and harder for a bigger leap.\n\nThere\u2019s more to it than that: you can wall-kick your way up shafts, while strategically placed blocks help you stop for a few seconds, jump backwards or take bigger leaps forward.\n\nThe interface has been designed so that you tap on the bottom fifth of the screen below the level window, so as not to obscure any action with your thumb. The iPad version has a thinner tap zone to keep more of its screen free for the levels.\n\nAs with all Mario games, replayability is key. Each level initially includes five pink coins among the regular gold ones. Collect the five, and a harder \u201cpurple coin\u201d version of the level is unlocked.\n\nCollect all five purple coins in that, and an even harder \u201cblack coin\u201d version unlocks where, in the words of Nintendo\u2019s demonstrator, \u201cthey expect you to be a bit more fancy\u201d with your acrobatics to collect everything.\n\nThere are plenty of alternative routes and secrets to find as you play through the game, while a bubble button can be tapped twice per level to float Mario backwards for a while: useful if you\u2019ve missed a crucial coin, or just want to maximise your score by taking another route.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Mario Run\u2019s Kingdom Builder mode and its shop.\n\nRally to the challenge\n\nAs you play through the World Tour mode you\u2019ll earn gold coins and rally tickets, which are used in Super Mario Run\u2019s other two modes: Toad Rally and Kingdom Builder.\n\nToad Rally is a challenge mode that costs one rally ticket to enter. You choose a level, then another player whose performance you want to try to beat. Your score is a combination of the coins you collect and the watching Toad characters that you \u201cimpress\u201d by pulling off acrobatic leaps.\n\nBeat the player you\u2019ve challenged, and you\u2019ll earn a bunch of colourful (red, blue, green, purple and/or yellow) Toads, but like spread betting, if you don\u2019t beat the other player, you\u2019ll lose Toads.\n\nWhat do Toads mean? Prizes. Or rather, you need a certain number of each to unlock items in the game\u2019s Kingdom Builder mode, where you spend your coins buying items to place in your mini-kingdom \u2013 some of which are purely decorative, while others \u2026 are not.\n\n(Nintendo is keeping some features of the game, the contents of its shop included, under wraps until it launches.)\n\nCoins, raffle tickets and Toads may sound like a potentially confusing system of interlocking virtual currencies. That said, it all seems to make sense within Super Mario Run, and many mobile gamers have already encountered similar systems in freemium games.\n\nReason for optimism\n\nGiven 2016 was a year of unpleasant surprises, Nintendo\u2019s fanbase would be forgiven for fretting about Super Mario Run being a crashing disappointment. Based on the preview code, it\u2019s looking more like one of the year\u2019s silver linings.\n\nIts developers appear to have walked the line between casual and hardcore players with success: you can play your way through the levels fairly easily at your own pace, albeit with the odd moment that may test the reflexes and rhythm of players whose experience is more Candy Crush than classic platformers.\n\nIf you\u2019re a speed-runner or a collect-everything completist, though, Super Mario Run looks to have plenty to challenge you, including additional characters to unlock \u2013 Luigi and Yoshi are the ones we\u2019re allowed to mention for now.\n\nOne question concerns whether Nintendo is planning to expand on the game\u2019s six worlds in the coming months with the new levels and characters that mobile players have been trained to expect from their freemium games.\n\nIf Nintendo does follow suit, it will have to decide whether to charge for them, although based on the quality of the first few worlds in Super Mario Run, it will have a good case for doing so.

It also comes with four tracks, two of which are culled from past Mario Kart outings and two new. Wild Woods sees you racing around a vast tree with gravity-taunting vertical sections, but the star of the show is the Animal Crossing-themed course, which randomly appears in one of four different seasons, changing details on and off the track. A sizeable chunk of new content, this pack conforms to Nintendo\u2019s peerless levels of polish and panache. Another update to the game is available free, and adds a feverishly fast 200cc mode, providing a challenge for players who find the 150cc cups too easy.

A \u201ccommunity assisted racing simulator\u201d, it\u2019s authentic good fun, eschewing frippery like rewinding time after you flub a corner. It also gets cross with you for cutting chicanes and using other cars as informal crash barriers. In return, we get staggeringly beautiful recreations of the world\u2019s racing tracks, and vehicles ranging from lowly go-karts to modern Formula One cars. It\u2019s worth working your way up from humble beginnings, because jumping straight behind the wheel of an Aston Martin will see you losing control like a drunken amateur, the light touch needed for steering and acceleration earned through painstaking hours. Unlike its peers, CARS gives you access to all its cars and tracks straight away, letting race wins stand on the satisfaction of driving well rather than the hackneyed industry standard of drip-feeding new content. Sadly, though, technical difficulties abound, from your car failing to respond to controls to races where there are no sound effects. Most can be overcome by simply restarting, but it\u2019s disappointing how often you\u2019ll need to do that.\n\nBandai Namco, \u00a336.99-\u00a342.99\n\nBroken Age: The Complete Adventure, PS4 & PS Vita\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Broken Age\n\nKickstarter-funded adventure Broken Age told two stories in old-school \u201cpoint and click\u201d style: one about a boy stuck on a spaceship with an overbearingly maternal AI, the other featuring a girl about to take part in a ritual called the Maiden\u2019s Feast in which she gets fed to a monster. The Complete Adventure adds a closing act in which the children swap places, the girl stranded in deep space and the boy preparing to be monster food. It\u2019s saved the developer from having to draw new locations, but it makes for a less visually interesting conclusion. The puzzles in the second half are more complicated and numerous, but new baddies are a letdown, even though the quality of script and voice acting remain excellent throughout. Aimed at older children and young adults, its themes of rebelling against authority and the rocky transition to adulthood are tackled with gentle humour and many movie references.

Although Wenger did reveal a couple of weeks\n\nago that his people had been watching Kant\u00e9 since the midfielder was 10\n\nyears old so, in fairness, in some cases Wenger has been aware of the\n\ntalent but just did not act quickly or persuasively enough to bring it to\n\nArsenal, a little bit like in the case of one of the young players of this\n\nseason, Anthony Martial. Still, never mind, if there\u2019s one thing Wenger has\n\nlearned over the last decade or so, it\u2019s that it\u2019s never too late to catch\n\nback up after letting others get ahead of you.

Currently on loan at\n\nBordeaux, Debuchy, also according to the Telegraph, is one of several\n\nplayers who will be ushered away from the Emirates for good this summer,\n\nalong with Matheiu Flamini, Kieran Gibbs, Mikel Arteta and Tomas Rosicky.\n\nAnd\u2013 look away now if you have grown weary or, indeed, sweary at hearing\n\nsimilar stories shortly after the close of the latest transfer window \u2013 Wenger will be given a bumper war chest to recruit top new talent. If not with Kant\u00e9, then Wenger will reportedly strengthen midfield by signing William Carvalho or \u2013 yes, there\u2019s definitely something familiar about all this \u2013 Victor Wanyama.\n\nWenger is also said to eager to sign Leicester\u2019s young left-back Ben\n\nChilwell and a top striker, preferably Pierre Emierick-Aubameyang but\n\nperhaps also Odion Ighalo.

Klopp also fancies rekindling his relationship with Mario G\u00f6tze even though the youngster once did the dirty on him by defecting from Dortmund to Bayern Munich. Among those going out the Anfield door, at whatever speed Klopp can propel them with a well-aimed boot, will be Christian Benteke.

The world champions qualified from their group without conceding but they also did so without impressing.\n\nJoachim L\u00f6w\u2019s team face Slovakia in Lille on Sunday after three performances that were solid but lacked spark in attack. They are the favourites to go through, of course, but they did lose to their opponents just a few weeks ago in a pre-Euro 2016 friendly, Marek Hamsik scoring a stunning goal in Augsburg as the visitors won 3-1.\n\nMario G\u00f3mez is likely to start up front again for Germany and scored in the last group game against Northern Ireland but the feeling is that, three games into the tournament, L\u00f6w still does not know what his best line-up is. The defence is settled with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng likely to be fit after a calf injury to partner Mats Hummels in central defence and so are the two defensive midfielders (Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos).\n\nThen comes the main dilemma: what to do with Mario G\u00f6tze, the player who won Germany the World Cup with his goal in the final against Argentina but who has been struggling for playing time at Bayern Munich this season after he fell out of favour with Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe 24-year-old started the tournament as L\u00f6w\u2019s false No9, against Ukraine, in front of three attacking midfielders, but failed to make an impact. In fact, Bastian Schweinsteiger, who came on to replace him in the 90th minute, managed to score in the three minutes he spent on the pitch. In the second game, against Poland, G\u00f6tze was again deployed as the side\u2019s main attacker but once more failed to impress and was this time taken off after 66 minutes.\n\nFinally, against Northern Ireland he was positioned on the left of the attacking three. Sadly, he did not fare much better there. Most coaches would probably have dropped him by now but L\u00f6w is desperately hoping that G\u00f6tze will come good.\n\nDidier Deschamps faces tyranny of choice against Republic of Ireland Read more\n\nBefore the tournament L\u00f6w said: \u201cMario was injured for a long time and I have seen in training that Mario is not, when it comes to fitness and sharpness, where he once was but technically he is so good, he has unbelievable possibilities and can work in very little space and decide games. I am still counting on him for the Euros.\u201d\n\nAs well as hoping that G\u00f6tze comes good it seems that L\u00f6w does not trust the other attacking options he has in the squad. Julian Draxler, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle and young Leroy San\u00e9 could all play instead of G\u00f6tze but only Draxler has been given a proper chance before being dropped to the bench.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that G\u00f3mez could carry the main attacking burden now that he has been reinstalled as the team\u2019s main striker, and take some weight off G\u00f6tze, Thomas M\u00fcller and Mesut \u00d6zil. G\u00f3mez has had a wonderful season on loan at Besiktas from Fiorentina and explained yesterday what it is that makes Germany so difficult to beat.\n\n\u201cWe always want the best for each other in every game,\u201d he told uefa.com. \u201cI was there when we lost to Italy in the 2012 semi-final. We were devastated and ended up feeling like the biggest losers of the tournament. But in 2014, you could see that each and every one of us would benefit from being world champions. Even from a distance, I saw clearly that the team has to function as a whole to win a tournament like a World Cup and that\u2019s the way it is today.\u201d\n\nEuro 2016: 10 transfer targets whose stock has risen sky-high in France Read more\n\nLooking ahead to the last-16 game against Slovakia, he said: \u201cWe will analyse our opponents very thoroughly; we played them recently and we know this game won\u2019t be a walk in the park. Those possible ties later in the tournament are a great prospect, though. This is a European Championship and you want games like that.\u201d\n\nThe Germany team has come under pressure for their lacklustre start to the tournament with the former international Michael Ballack saying that they lacked leaders. L\u00f6w, however, was very dismissive. \u201cThings repeat themselves so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe discussion conjures a smile from me. In 2014 there was the discussion that we have no leading players. Then we were world champions and they were suddenly the great leading players. Now we play a 0-0 and have this discussion again. The players have great leadership.\u201d\n\nAnd now, as the serious business begins, is the time to show it, starting with Slovakia on Sunday.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.4, "magnitude": 0.4}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Marcus Christenson", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2015-09-07": [{"author": "Disney Infinity 3.0: Star Wars starter pack\n\n(PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox 360; Disney Interactive Studios; cert: 7)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThis year the Disney Infinity series of toys-to-life games has a trump card over the competition \u2013 Star Wars.

Since 1985 the Super Mario Bros series has written the blueprints for the entire genre, defining the gold standard for movement, control and design and now, finally, gamers have the chance to see whether they can match Nintendo\u2019s finest moments.\n\nSuper Mario Maker is a comprehensive level editing tool-set that turns the Wii U GamePad into a perfect canvas to draw your own courses. Being Nintendo, that toolset is both elegant and intuitive. It rewards serious tinkering and allows wannabe designers to knock out playable courses in just minutes, or to labour for hours over intricate masterpieces.\n\nThere are 64 pre-made concept levels included to encourage creativity and naturally everything can be shared online for what will no doubt turn into an endless Mario resource. Just like the games that inspired it, this package is bursting with personality, ideas and surprises and can make a homebrew Miyamoto out of anybody. RH\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the best in the series yet.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\n\n(PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC; Konami; cert: 18)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe silver screen has long influenced the Metal Gear universe, unsurprisingly given that series creator Hideo Kojima is an avowed film fanatic. His games are distinctly cinematic and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is no different. Like its predecessors it takes the form of a military thriller delivered as a stealth-oriented shooter.\n\nYet this game is also much more than that. Borrowing from westerns, war films and even the narrative structuring of contemporary high-budget television, Kojima\u2019s latest is a remarkable achievement. It is a vast creation that excels in providing dramatic tension and action, and surpasses the previous iterations in letting player choice rule supreme. Numerous hostile missions let you decide your approach, strategy and method, shaping the experience as it is played, and making for an empowering undertaking, complemented by tremendous visual and aural polish.\n\nThis may be Kojima\u2019s final contribution to the series; if so, he is bowing out with what could well be his magnum opus. WF\n\nDevil\u2019s Third is a bad attempt to mix genres.\n\nDevil\u2019s Third\n\n(Wii U; Nintendo; cert: 18, out now)\n\n\u2605\n\nDeveloper Valhalla studios have ended up with a Frankenstein\u2019s monster \u2013 clunky and severely dated, the game disappoints in every respect.\n\nThe mixture of gameplay types is severely imbalanced from the off. Guns are less risky and more efficient than the dubious melee combat, which only allows players to attack one enemy at a time. Equally, an ineffective dodge and tiny regenerating health pool also make ranged combat more favourable but no less repetitive.\n\nThen, there is the game\u2019s campy plot about global insurrection and military fetishism \u2013 predictably mediocre and never pushing the goofiness far enough, it ensures that what could have been a guilty pleasure is instead a dismal bore. The poor quality of the experience comes to a climax in awfully designed boss battles where one wrong move means instant death and it is never clear what exactly constitutes a wrong move.\n\nDevil\u2019s Third has clearly been stuck in development hell for some time and borrows heavily from Call of Duty \u2013 but about five years too late. Avoid. RS\n\nUpdated and expanded, Gears of War is well worth a revisit.\n\nGears of War: Ultimate Edition\n\n(Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC; Microsoft; cert: 18, out now)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOn its debut, almost a decade ago, Gears of War was significant for its contribution to the development of blockbuster gaming. The third-person sci-fi shooter\u2019s focus on making the player find and fire from cover had a huge influence on game design that can still be felt today. Now that original release is back on a next-gen console, given a graphics update, expanded with the previously PC-exclusive content, and sporting an improved online multiplayer mode.\n\nThe original, populated with somewhat relentlessly adrenalin-charged space marines, played infamous tribute to many of the \u201cbro\u201d subculture\u2019s archetypes, and today that tone feels no less brash. Yet Gears\u2019s machismo is but a front for a shooter surprisingly sensitive to its players\u2019 needs. This is a fast game that never wants to leave you unsure of your goals, and keeps you in stride with the superbly paced action. The AI and gameplay\u2019s age is now showing, but along with Gears\u2019s modest primitiveness there is also a clarity of purpose sometimes absent in newer shooters. The result is distinct, engrossing and well worth revisiting nine years on.

That was of course substantial and had a big impact on the personal plans of many young people. But the magnitude was not so different from the losses suffered by other generations, although of course the young do not have the same assets and savings to fall back on in tough economic times. Even more worrying was the sharp increase in youth unemployment in Europe.\n\nEuropean job market is rigged against younger workers, says Draghi Read more\n\nAre you worried about the position of young adults in Europe and is this an increasingly urgent issue?\n\nYouth unemployment is a tragedy and prevents people from playing a full and meaningful part in society. If every second young person is out of work \u2013 as is still the case in some countries in Europe \u2013 it seriously harms the economy, because people willing to work cannot work and skills are not developed. And it threatens social harmony. Unemployment can lead in the long run to increased social problems and ill health.\n\nAre you worried about future consumption levels of young adults, as this group \u2013 who have been especially \u201cscarred\u201d by the global recession \u2013 move into middle age?\n\nConsumption within a society is determined partly by wealth distribution, but even more important is that the young generation can participate in the labour market in a fair way. In many countries the labour market is set up to protect older \u201cinsiders\u201d \u2013 people with permanent, high-paid contracts and shielded by strong labour laws. The side-effect is that young people are stuck with lower-paid, temporary contracts and get fired first in crisis times. That also means that employers are reluctant to invest in young people, so the incomes of this generation stay lower over their lifetime.\n\nWhat might be the forces at work here \u2013 demographics, changing workplaces, fiscal and monetary policy \u2013 that mean young adults appear to be receiving little of the rewards from two-and-a-half decades of average economic growth?\n\nNobody stays young forever. The crucial question is whether a person can participate fully in the economy over his or her lifetime \u2013 get a good education, find a job, buy a home for the family. Income and wealth follow. What makes me worry is that increasing inequality might prevent people from doing that. This is an issue all our societies need to look at carefully. The ECB\u2019s role in that is to maintain price stability, which prevents unfair redistribution. For example, our research shows that in the euro area too low inflation results in redistribution from younger, more indebted households to older households that are typically net creditors.\n\nWhat matters is that young people, as they move through life, have the opportunities to build up wealth, too\n\nCurrent retirees are wealthier than ever. What opportunities does this bring to Europe?\n\nIn an ageing society, the fact that retirees are getting wealthier isn\u2019t necessarily abnormal \u2013 older people need to accumulate more wealth to finance living longer. As they spend their wealth during retirement, it passes back to the younger generations. So wealth creation isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. What matters is that young people, as they move through life, have the opportunities to build up wealth, too.\n\nDo you think younger adults today will have as good a standard of living as pensioners today when they retire?\n\nThat\u2019s our common choice. Our standard of living depends on the strength of our economy. We need a more open, flexible, innovative and business-friendly society. Much focus is put on the central bank to raise growth, and it can contribute through price stability and a stable financial system. But in the long run real growth is driven by what the economy can produce. That is much more about ideas, technology, flexibility, motivation, skills. It is up to elected governments to set a growth-friendly environment.\n\nYou often talk about the need for structural reform in employment. What do you mean by this?\n\nThere are lots of forms this can take. Just to give one example, the kurzarbeit scheme in Germany allowed employers to adjust working time during the crisis without firing people. But there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all model. Every society has its challenges and preferences. The idea generally is to create a fair and flexible labour market where companies do not fear taking on staff when they need them and specific groups of people are not structurally disadvantaged at times when employers need to cut wage bills.\n\nWhat can central banks and governments do to ease or resolve these issues?\n\nEveryone has a vital interest in a prospering economy. So bringing down high levels of youth unemployment is a priority for everyone. As I said, the best contribution central banks can make here is to live up to their mandates. We can only encourage elected governments to take the necessary steps to create jobs and make their societies fairer. Over the longer term, by far the most important thing for young people is investing in education and skills. Skills are a person\u2019s passport through life, and in a fast-changing digital economy, the premium paid for skills is only likely to rise. Equipping people for tomorrow\u2019s world is the best way to raise incomes and reduce inequality.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.2, "magnitude": 0.2}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Shiv Malik", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}, [{"author": "Europe\u2019s economies are rigged to protect older workers at the cost of new employees, the president of the European Central Bank has told the Guardian.\n\nMario Draghi also said \u201ctragic\u201d high levels of youth unemployment had the potential to threaten social harmony in Europe and that rock-bottom inflation was damaging the prospects of Generation Y by redistributing their wealth to older people.\n\nMario Draghi: 'Reducing youth unemployment is a priority for everyone' Read more\n\nDraghi told the Guardian there should be a \u201cmore open, flexible, innovative and business-friendly society\u201d that did not disadvantage new workers because companies were afraid of taking on new staff.

If every second young person is out of work \u2013 as is still the case in some countries in Europe \u2013 it seriously harms the economy ... and it threatens social harmony,\u201d said Draghi.\n\nDraghi said the situation for young people was made worse by a lack of inflation, which according to the bank\u2019s own research was increasing inequality and damaging their prospects.\n\nLow inflation means that savings, likely to be held by older people, maintain their value, while debts, which are more likely to be held by younger people, do not erode.\n\n\u201cNobody stays young forever.

But young people should not be put in a position where we are told that it is a choice between low-paid jobs not matching our qualifications, unpaid internships or no jobs at all. \u201d\n\nNear-zero inflation and fears of decades of Japanese-style low or no growth have been the latest issues to beset Europe since the 2008 financial crash.\n\n\n\nWhy the falling oil price may not lead to boom Read more\n\nIn the euro area, inflation has been below 1% for more than two years and is expected to drop further because of a dramatic collapse in oil prices. In February, Draghi said he would \u201crefuse to surrender\u201d to its effects.\n\nThursday\u2019s unprecedented move by Draghi to create an environment of even cheaper money by reducing interest rates on borrowing and expanding its money printing programme failed to stimulate markets at close.\n\n\n\nDraghi\u2019s interview comes amid a Guardian investigation into the incomes of Generation Y, also known as millennials, showing they are almost no better off in terms of disposable income than their parents were in a number of countries across Europe and America.\n\nHis comments are published on the day that sees the launch of the first Europe-wide intergenerational index showing that ageing populations and the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis have led to the prospects of young people across the EU hitting a 10-year low.\n\nThe index, drawn up by the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank, found that alongside increased future debt repayments, the average share of health spending consumed by the over-60s across the EU rose from 42% in 2000 to more than 54% in 2013.\n\n\n\nIn effect, over-60s consumed more than half of all healthcare resources in the EU, despite representing less than a quarter of all EU citizens.\n\n\n\nPension spend was also higher than 10% of GDP in some of Europe\u2019s largest economies: France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and the UK.\n\nAngus Hanton, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said the findings \u201cshould act as a wakeup call to policymakers\u201d.\n\n\u201cYounger generations are being systematically disadvantaged. We cannot expect the young to carry the burden of an ageing population if we do not give them the tools required to become economically active citizens. It is therefore in all generations\u2019 interests to prioritise spending on the young,\u201d Hanton said.\n\nAsked whether today\u2019s younger adults would have as good a standard of living as pensioners today when they came to retire, Draghi responded: \u201cThat\u2019s our common choice. Our standard of living depends on the strength of our economy.\n\n\u201cMuch focus is put on the central bank to raise growth, and it can contribute through price stability and a stable financial system.

1992, according to an imprisoned Cosa Nostra hitman.\n\nMaurizio Avola, 54 \u2013 who is currently serving a life sentence for his part in 43 murders and 40 armed robberies \u2013 told the Guardian that mobster bosses planned an ambush involving about a dozen gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives.\n\nThe attack was only called off when the scale of Cuomo\u2019s security detail became apparent, he said.\n\nAvola said that after the assassinations of prominent anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992, Cosa Nostra bosses decided to escalate their war against the Italian state and its allies.\n\n\u201cThe aim was to target politicians or members of institutions in order to send out a clear message,\u201d he said, in an interview via messages carried by his lawyer.\n\nWhen Cuomo\u2019s visit to Italy was announced, Avola\u2019s godfather, Aldo Ercolano, told him that the New York governor would be an \u201cexcellent target\u201d.\n\n\n\nTargeting a prominent American would also send a warning to the law enforcement agencies who had allowed several prominent mafia turncoats to start new lives in the US under assumed identities, Avola said.\n\n\u201cCuomo was a symbol of America which during those years hosted collaborators who wanted out of Cosa Nostra and then got their bosses arrested. His death would have sent a strong signal to New York. It would have made them understand what happens to those who stand in the Mafia\u2019s way,\u201d he said.\n\nCuomo arrived in Rome on 19 November 1992 for a week of meetings. Soon after his arrival, a journalist from Corriere della Sera asked whether having an Italian surname was damaging for an American politician.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maurizio Avola. Photograph: Fabrizio Villa/AP\n\nCuomo replied: \u201cOf course, any Italian American politician risks being associated with the mafia, not least because the media continuously plays on this image.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, according to Avola a much more immediate risk was taking shape in the city of Messina, where a mafia hit squad was planning a daylight attack on Cuomo in the main square.\n\nAround a dozen gunmen armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and explosives were to carry out the ambush, while accomplices were ready to block potential escape routes, said Avola.\n\n\n\nBut just a few days before Cuomo was due in Messina, Ercolano called off the attack.\n\n\u201cThe American politician arrived with extremely tight surveillance, lots of bodyguards and a bulletproof car. It made the execution impossible,\u201d Avola said. \u201cReluctantly, Aldo Ercolano ordered the \u2018men of honour\u2019 to withdraw.\u2019\u2019\n\nBorn in Catania in 1962, Avola is believed to have killed about 80 people, including journalists, lawyers, politicians and mobsters, before becoming a pentito, or informer.\n\n\n\nKnown as \u201cOcchi di Ghiaccio\u201d or Ice Eyes because of his cold-blooded blue gaze, he was recruited as a hitman by the Santapaola family, one of the most feared and powerful in the Sicilian criminal underworld.\n\nHe was arrested on a tip-off in 1993, the day after killing a former friend and fellow mafioso. Avola concluded that he had been betrayed by his boss, and a year later, he decided to cooperate with police, revealing details that led to the opening of new investigations and the arrest of more than 100 \u2018men of honour\u2019.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Just a few days before Cuomo was due in Messina, the attack was called off. Photograph: Alamy\n\nHe is currently serving a life sentence for his murders and 40 armed robberies in a special prison for mafia informers in northern Italy \u2013 but will be freed in 2019 because of his cooperation with authorities. For security reasons, the Guardian is not naming the prison where he is being held.\n\nA senior source at Palermo magistrate\u2019s court confirmed that an investigation into Avola\u2019s allegations of a plot to kill Cuomo was still open, but said that details of the case were confidential.\n\nAvola\u2019s lawyer, Ugo Colonna, said that his client\u2019s allegations may help shed some light on the history of that period of Cosa Nostra.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnderstanding why the mafia wanted to eliminate the governor of New York, in 1992, could also help us to understand the violence of the bosses who, in those years, were waging a real war against the state,\u201d he said.\n\nIgnazio De Francisci, a Palermo prosecutor who worked alongside Falcone and Borsellino, said that in the early 1990s, mafia bosses had already spread their actions beyond Sicily.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Cosa Nostra felt invincible, capable of doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe USA was closely collaborating with Italy in the fight against the mafia. If Cosa Nostra pulled back from the brink, just a few days before the scheduled date of assassination, it\u2019s because it knew it would have been impossible to pull it off and they certainly couldn\u2019t afford to leave a job half-finished.\u201d\n\n\n\nCuomo died from heart failure on 1 January 2015. His son, Andrew Cuomo, is the current governor of New York.

The weekend political rift in France over austerity only served to reinforce the idea that action probably needed to be taken.\n\nOn top of that, there was a strong start in the US after consumer confidence hit its highest level since October 2007 and durable goods sales surged, albeit helped by big aircraft orders for Boeing at the Farnborough air show in July.\n\nHopes of easing tensions in Ukraine and Russia, as well as in Gaza, also helped sentiment, as did news of the proposed $11.4bn takeover of Canada's Tim Hortons by America's Burger King.\n\nSo the FTSE 100 finished at its highest level since 7 July, up 47.51 points to 6822.76, although share volumes were still stuck in the summer lull.\n\nBanks were boosted by the talk of possible QE from the ECB, with Barclays 2.45p better at 225.25p.

For now inflation remains well short of that and could turn negative again in coming months, he added.\n\nDraghi warned that those who threatened ECB independence with \u201ccriticisms of a certain type\u201d were making Europe\u2019s economic problems worse.\n\n\u201cWe have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the eurozone not only for Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d\n\nAngela Merkel countered that it was legitimate for Germans to discuss how far interest rates had fallen, but \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be confused with interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is independent in its policies,\u201d the German chancellor told reporters while on a visit to the Netherlands.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s ECB news conference in Frankfurt Draghi said a range of initiatives announced in March would need time to bear fruit but he insisted the bank\u2019s stance was working. In last month\u2019s unprecedented package of growth-bolstering measures, the ECB cut interest rates to an all-time low, expanded its money-printing programme and reduced a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory.\n\nThere had been some speculation in financial markets before Thursday that faced with global uncertainties and an ongoing threat of deflation, the ECB could cut rates further still and launch \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 whereby central banks print money so finance ministries can hand it out to citizens to spend.\n\nBut Draghi was swift to snuff out speculation and said the ECB had not discussed helicopter money. He did emphasise, however, that borrowing costs would stay low and he hinted they could possibly be cut even further.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,\u201d the ECB chief said in his opening statement to the press conference.\n\nThat outlook will infuriate many German savers, frustrated by years of low returns on their pension pots. But Draghi rejected implications that the ECB was responsible for all the problems of pension funds.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that pension funds and others, insurance companies, are seriously affected by the low interest rates. I would caution them not to blame on low rates everything that has gone wrong in the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nDraghi also renewed the pressure on governments to play a role in shoring up growth in the eurozone, echoing recent comments by the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Christine Lagarde that central banks alone cannot fuel the recovery.\n\n\u201cLow interest rates are a symptom of low growth and low inflation. If we want to return to higher interest rates we need to return to higher growth and higher inflation,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the UK\u2019s June referendum on EU membership, Draghi said: \u201cThe participation of Britain in the EU is welcome,.

That, at least, is what many in the market assume \u2013 that Draghi has persuaded the doubters and the ECB will serve full-blown quantitative easing on a colossal scale next week.\n\nIt may not be so simple. Expectations are so high that the rumoured \u20ac500bn (\u00a3390bn) programme of buying sovereign bonds might be viewed as a disappointment. The ECB is late to the QE party and deflation has arrived already in the eurozone.\n\nHow about \u20ac1tn? That would be more impressive. But investors might conclude that a cap of any size betrays German hesitation and objections. Draghi, remember, is the man who, in another context, coined the phrase \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d.\n\nThere is also the outside possibility, of course, that the ECB does nothing next week and opts to reconsider QE at its March meeting. That would astound markets. Investors might conclude that an ECB that can\u2019t summon the unity to launch QE in the current economic climate is incapable of saving the euro.\n\nDraghi is in a horrible position. Expectations are so high they will be hard to meet. That\u2019s the price of two years of dithering.\n\nBT v Ofcom\n\nHas Ofcom just shot BT\u2019s football fox? Well, the wound is definitely not mortal but it will cause some pain, to judge by BT\u2019s angry reaction. \u201cMisconceived\u201d is a word the telecoms company reserves for occasions when it is seriously miffed. An appeal is almost certain.\n\nAt one level, the row is merely technical. Should the cost of providing \u201cfree\u201d football and other sports to BT\u2019s superfast broadband customers be included when calculating the company\u2019s overall cost-base for fibre?\n\nOfcom says yes and its answer matters because the regulator wants to introduce a \u201cmargin squeeze\u201d test on BT to ensure that competitors can make a profit when they buy access to the group\u2019s fibre network. BT must maintain a decent gap between its wholesale prices for fibre and the prices it charges its own retail broadband customers.\n\nThe margin test was expected, and wouldn\u2019t itself cause BT to splutter. But the inclusion of sports costs in the calculations will make the test harder to pass. Failure would mean BT would have to raise its retail prices or cut its wholesale prices, thereby giving rivals a leg-up.\n\nThe good news for BT is that it has passed the test this time. But that\u2019s as things stand today. Champions League footie is coming to BT Sport and the next round of bidding for Premier League action has almost arrived. The latter could affect the squeeze test if BT bids high on Premier League rights and wins. Ofcom intends to apply the same regulatory logic to any mobile offers that are bundled into superfast broadband deals. That, perhaps, is even more significant as BT is in the process of buying EE for \u00a312.5bn.\n\nThe way BT tells it, it is the pay-TV challenger trying to give Sky a run for its money for the first time in 25 years. Well, yes, that\u2019s true, and the ambition is laudable. But it is surely also reasonable to ensure that non-football fans don\u2019t contribute via the back door to the great corporate BT/Sky sports showdown. If that is the effect of Ofcom\u2019s \u201csafeguard,\u201d it is a sensible move by the regulator.\n\nRetail rethink?\n\nAnother day, another retailer grumbling about Black Friday. This time it\u2019s Home Retail Group, owner of Argos, where chief executive John Walden says \u201cthe draw of discounts affected trade both before and after that busy weekend as consumers satisfied their Christmas shopping lists with bargains\u201d. What did he expect?\n\nWalden, of course, is not that naive. Argos joined the Black Friday malarkey but tried not to get sucked in too deeply. Thus Argos\u2019s like-for-like sales were weak \u2013 the rise was just 0.1% in the final three months of 2014 \u2013 but the group protected its profit margins.\n\nIn theory, that ought to have reassured investors; in practice, the shares fell 6%. But one can understand why. Non-food retailers have got themselves into a fine old mess by importing the Black Friday nonsense from the US.\n\nMost promise to slow things down next time. But that\u2019s what they say now, when the chaos in the supply chain feels fresh. Next November, one suspects, they won\u2019t be able to help themselves.\n\nSomebody should break ranks and run Black Friday in August, when the wheeze might be a useful way of drumming up demand in a quiet month. Nobody on this side of the Atlantic cares one jot about the loose association with US Thanksgiving.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Nils Pratley",

commercial interest rates to boost the currency zone's struggling economy.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) boss Mario Draghi is expected to reduce the rate at which commercial banks borrow from 0.25% to 0.15% to encourage business lending.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based institution is also expected to cut the interest rate it pays to banks that keep funds on deposit in a further move to discourage lenders from hoarding cash.\n\nDraghi is under pressure to kickstart bank lending after recent figures showed that Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Portugal saw their economies contract in the first three months of the year while France stagnated. Only Germany prevented the eurozone from heading back into recession after after a 0.8% growth spurt.\n\nLow inflation across the 18 members of the currency zone has also discouraged shoppers from spending on the high street and undermined business investment and union-led attempts to raise wages.\n\nIn April inflation rose to 0.7 from 0.5% in March, but remained in what the ECB calls the \"danger zone\" of below 1%, and well below the ECB's target of close to 2%.\n\nWorse still, figures for May showed that Italy's EU-harmonised inflation rate eased to a weaker-than-expected 0.4% year-on-year from 0.5% in April. Corresponding inflation in Spain was 0.2%, down from 0.3%.\n\nBut the ECB is unlikely to mimic the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England and pump billions of euros into the banking system with a programme of quantitative easing (QE).\n\nThe ECB, which will announce its decision on Thursday, is known to have come close to voting for QE, but conservative forces on the governing council have resisted the plans.\n\n\"We are aware of the risks of a too prolonged low inflation period,\" Draghi told an ECB conference outside Lisbon last week, adding that he and his colleagues had to be \"particularly watchful\" for any negative price spiral.\n\nAt the last policy meeting in May, Draghi said the ECB was comfortable with acting in June if updated staff forecasts showed the situation remained the same or worse.\n\n\"Draghi's May press conference raised market expectations of action, and the ECB will want to appear bold,\" said Nikolaus Keis, economist at Unicredit. \"The risk is that monetary conditions may quickly start tightening anew if the ECB's moves are perceived as too timid.\"\n\nHoward Archer, chief European economist at HS Global Insight, said economic conditions in the eurozone \"certainly justify strong action\".\n\nIn the absence of further monetary support, the euro would rise against the dollar, hurting exporters and deterring business investment, he said.\n\n\"Ever since Mr. Draghi's comments after the 8 May ECB policy meeting that the ECB is \"comfortable\" with taking action in June to counter prolonged very low eurozone inflation and the strength of the euro, it has looked much more likely than not that the bank will follow through and move at its 5 June policy meeting.\n\nHe added: \"However, we remain doubtful that the ECB will undertake full blown QE. We suspect this will only happen if eurozone consumer price inflation falls to new lows below 0.5% over the coming months and eurozone growth falters further.\"", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Phillip Inman", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}, [{"author": "The European Central Bank governor has charmed the markets with words. But this week he must make bold policy decisions to unite a region increasingly riven by economic disparities\n\nThe meeting will be held on the day before the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, but make no mistake: Thursday is D-day for the European Central Bank. That's D as in Draghi, because after all of the ECB governor's silver-tongued manipulation of the market \u2013 all the nudges, winks and hints \u2013 the financial markets now require Mario Draghi to do more than just talk.\n\nExpectations are high, probably unrealistically so. After the bloody nose received by mainstream parties in last week's elections to the European parliament, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers had some harsh things to say on US news network CNN about the mess that policymakers had made of things: \"The European common market, European monetary union, was an elitist project that was driven by elites, that led to consequences that were entirely unpredicted by elites, that have been catastrophic for millions of people.\"\n\nDraghi can do little to rekindle love for the idea of ever-closer union in Europe \u2013 a project damaged, perhaps beyond repair, by recession, unemployment and austerity. Nor is he in a position to eradicate the structural problems of the euro \u2013 its one-size-fits-all interest rates, its inbuilt deflationary tendencies \u2013 that have been obvious since its creation. These are beyond his remit. The \"elite\" lambasted by Summers has to decide whether to press ahead with closer fiscal integration \u2013 a centralised budget that might make the single currency work better \u2013 in the face of clear voter hostility to greater unity.\n\nInstead, the ECB meeting will have a less ambitious, but still crucial, agenda. As Investec economist Philip Shaw puts it, Europe's central bank has four key objectives this week: \"To ease policy to meet its inflation target; to prevent inflation expectations from being dislodged to the downside and increasing the risks of deflation; to stem upward pressure on the euro; and to secure and preferably speed up the recovery, possibly by encouraging credit flow.\"\n\nThis is not just a question of preventing the eurozone from becoming the new Japan \u2013 where activity is relentlessly weak and both consumers and businesses are deterred from spending by the knowledge that deflation will lead to prices being lower in the future than they are today. The ECB also has to take into account that some parts of the eurozone have suffered from Great Depression-style falls in output since 2008 and that many economies are operating way below pre-recession levels.\n\nWhat's more, the big discrepancies in economic performance across the eurozone \u2013 especially between Germany and France \u2013 will put increasing strains on the central bank.\n\nEstimates by the Centre for Economic and Business Research suggest Greek economic output will be more than 23% lower at the end of 2014 than it was in 2008. Italy, Spain and Portugal will have seen declines of 7%, 6% and 6% respectively while even Ireland, the poster child for austerity, will still be operating 4% below its pre-recession level.\n\nThe eurozone emerged from double-dip recession a year ago, but its recovery has been modest. Exports have been hampered by the slowdown in the global economy and by the strength of the euro. Investment has been constrained by the unwillingness or inability of banks to lend. Unemployment, which averages 12% across the eurozone, has discouraged consumer spending.\n\nLatest data suggests that consumer and business confidence is picking up, but even so, growth this year currently looks like coming in at around 1% \u2013 not fast enough to prevent disinflationary pressure from growing. The cost of living across the 18-nation single-currency area rose at an annual rate of 0.7% in April, well below the ECB's target of \"below but close to 2%\". The bank will publish its own forecasts for inflation on Tuesday, but markets anticipate that it will pencil in a figure of only around 1.3% for 2016. That leaves Draghi with plenty of scope for action and he said at last month's ECB meeting that he and his fellow policymakers would feel \"comfortable\" with acting next time.\n\nAll that is at issue is what form of the attempted policy stimulus will take. There are three possibilities:\n\n\u25a0 Cut interest rates First on the list will be lowering rates. Borrowing costs in the eurozone are already close to zero but Draghi will go further. The ECB's refinancing rate \u2013 the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from Frankfurt \u2013 is currently 0.25% and a cut to 0.15% is widely predicted.\n\nOf rather greater interest will be what Draghi does to the deposit rate \u2013 the interest banks get when they lodge money with the ECB. The strong speculation is that at this week's meeting it will become the first major central bank in the world to announce a negative rate, probably -0.1%. What that means is that will cost banks money to deposit money at the ECB. The hope is that they will lend the money out instead.\n\n\u25a0 Boost lending The second item on the agenda will be whether more targeted steps need to be taken to boost lending, especially in some of the weaker countries on the eurozone's periphery. Draghi has noted that it is much harder for good businesses to get access to credit in Spain than it is in Germany, with figures showing that 25% of viable Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises are constrained by a lack of finance, compared with just 1% in Germany.\n\nHere, the ECB is likely to come up with its own version of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which gave banks access to cheaper credit but only on condition that it was lent rather than hoarded. In the past, the ECB has used long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide help to eurozone banks: a more targeted LTRO looks likely this week.\n\n\u25a0 Start printing money The really big question is whether the ECB is prepared to go the whole hog and announce its own quantitative easing programme, something already tried by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.\n\nMost analysts believe the threat of deflation would need to get more serious before the ECB took this step, although Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics thinks that, to end an economic and financial struggle that is now longer-lasting than the second world war, QE will ultimately be required.\n\n\"We still think a bolder programme of asset purchases will be necessary to get the recovery going and avoid prolonged deflation,\" she says.\n\nCountry by country: how invididual economies are faring\n\nGermany Europe's biggest economy began 2014 strongly, fuelling hopes it could drag the eurozone with it. Growth hit a three-year high \u2013 but the recovery appears to be slowing. Business confidence dipped last month after exports fell by the largest amount in 11 months.\n\nFrance The new \"sick man of Europe\" is exhibiting some alarming symptoms as it falls further behind its neighbours. The economy stagnated in the first quarter of 2014, and unemployment hit another record high in April. No surprise that only 3% of the population wants President Hollande to run again in 2017.\n\nItaly Almost 10% was wiped off the size of Italy's economy after a 27-month recession that only ended last autumn. Charismatic prime minister Matteo Renzi now promises reforms to make Italy more competitive. But, worryingly, the economy went into reverse again between January and March.\n\nSpain The Spanish economy is finally heading in the right direction, after its banking sector was propped up by a \u20ac41bn bailout programme. But its jobless rate remains a stain on the eurozone recovery, with more than one in four adults still out of work.\n\nPortugal Lisbon emerged from its bailout programme last month, but faces many more years of cutbacks if Portugal is to hit its deficit targets. The national debt is now a concerning 129% of national output; no wonder economists were alarmed that GDP shrank by 0.7% in the last quarter.\n\nGreece The six-year depression is expected to end this year, and Greece made a remarkably successful return to the bond markets in April. But political uncertainty is mounting: with the coalition's majority down to just two, could Athens be forced into an early election?\n\nIreland After three traumatic years, Ireland successfully left its bailout programme last December. But years of cuts lie ahead \u2013 former Taoiseach John Bruton predicts another 10 years of austerity budgets unless growth accelerates. Workers are suffering a wage squeeze, with average earnings falling in May.\n\nCyprus The island is struggling to return to normal after the trauma of last year's bailout, which sent it into a deep recession. There are still strict restrictions on transferring money overseas, and Cypriot ministers have warned the economy would suffer badly if tougher sanctions were imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.\n\nSlovenia Tough austerity and privatisations have helped maintain investors' confidence and shored up its banking sector. But they cost prime minister Alenka Bratusek the leadership of her party. A snap general election is coming in July, raising fears that Slovenia's reform programme could stumble.\n\nAustria Austria epitomises the classic northern core of the eurozone, with the lowest jobless rate of any member of the single currency. But its economy may be hitting a sticky patch \u2013 manufacturers report that new orders are stagnating.\n\nFinland Conditions have deteriorated since 2012 \u2013 the country has tumbled into recession and economists fear it may not pull out until 2015. With household debt rising and firms regularly issuing profit warnings, Finland is no longer a model to the rest of Europe.\n\nNetherlands A housing market crash has left many households deep in negative equity. That's hitting consumer spending, with retail sales slumping by 2.2% in March. Like Finland, the Dutch economy has deteriorated just as the southern periphery has improved.\n\nGraeme Wearden", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}]], "2016-07-18": [{"author": "Bayern Munich\u2019s chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has confirmed that the Germany forward Mario G\u00f6tze has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a potential move.\n\nWest Ham and Leicester in contention for Toulouse\u2019s Wissam Ben Yedder Read more\n\nG\u00f6tze, who was linked with a transfer to Liverpool earlier in the summer, has struggled for game time since controversially leaving Dortmund for their rivals in 2013 despite scoring the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final.\n\nNow the 24-year-old appears close to a return to the Westfalenstadion, with Bayern holding out for a fee of around \u00a320m for the player who has just one year of his contract remaining.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that talks with Borussia Dortmund have taken place,\u201d Rummenigge told Sport1. \u201cThere have also been talks with his agent, but the deal is not done just yet.

and antisemitism on Twitter and pointing out that his foster mother is Jewish, issued an apology for any offence caused.\n\nBalotelli submitted observations on the incident to the FA on Friday in

Shares fell across Europe after the latest breakdown in talks between Athens and its creditors diminished hopes of a deal being agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday.\n\nGiving evidence to the European parliament in Brussels, Draghi said: \u201cWe need a strong and comprehensive agreement with Greece. And we need it very soon.\u201d His remarks came amid evidence of the fragile state of Greece\u2019s banks, where the pace of deposit withdrawals increased to \u20ac400m (\u00a3289m) on Monday.\n\nGreek debt default looks more likely by the day Read more\n\nCapital flight is making Greece more dependent on emergency funding from the ECB but Draghi hinted that there would be no immediate loss of support from Frankfurt, despite the souring of the relationship between Athens and its creditors.\n\n\u201cWhile all actors will now need to go the extra mile, the ball lies squarely in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nAlexis Tspiras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, showed no sign of giving in to demands to make the state pension less generous, raise VAT or water down his government\u2019s plans to reform labour laws in favour of workers.\n\n\u201cWe will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism,\u201d Tsipras told the Greek newspaper Efimerida ton Syntakton. \u201cWe do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\u201d\n\nHe blamed \u201cpolitical expediency\u201d on the part of lenders for the impasse and their insistence on new cuts in pensions \u201cafter five years of looting under the bailouts\u201d. The stance adopted by Tsipras infuriated officials at the European Commission in Brussels, who took the unusual step of releasing details of how an attempt to revive talks on Sunday broke down in less than an hour.\n\nThe \u201clast-chance\u201d negotiations represented a worsening of the situation as the Greeks sought to reopen issues already agreed upon, EU officials said on Monday. Signalling disenchantment with the Greek negotiations, the officials voiced deep pessimism that a deal can be struck.\n\nWhy this week is vital for Greece and the eurozone Read more\n\n\u201cWe are ready to convene at very short notice. The only condition is that something serious is on the table that makes discussions productive. That has not been possible,\u201d said an official briefed on the events of the past three days.\n\nGreek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said he is not planning to present new reform proposals at a meeting of the eurogroup committee of eurozone finance ministers later this week, according to excerpts from a German newspaper interview published on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAsked if he would present such a list, Varoufakis was quoted as saying: \u201cNo, because the eurogroup is not the right place to present proposals which haven\u2019t been discussed and negotiated on a lower level before.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, the Greek negotiation team is \u201cavailable at any time\u201d to find a comprehensive solution with its partners, Varoufakis said, adding that officials from the three institutions representing Greece\u2019s lenders needed to come back to the negotiation table \u201cwith a clear, robust mandate\u201d.\n\n\n\nVaroufakis repeated his call to German chancellor Angela Merkel to give his country a \u201cspeech of hope\u201d, to signal Europe was ready to end its demands for austerity, similar to that given to Germany at the end of the second world war.\n\n\n\nThe meeting of the eurogroup committee of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg is seen as yet another last chance to reach a deal before Greece\u2019s current bailout package expires at the end of the month.\n\nAthens must pay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund by 30 June and requires the release of a further \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds in order to meet the payment. In return, Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the ECB, European commission and the IMF \u2013 are demanding economic reforms.\n\nResponding to Tsipras\u2019s statement that he would patiently wait for a call to resume talks, an EU official responded: \u201cHe may not have time for patience.\u201d As Brussels considers how to cope with a Greek default, Berlin is said to be particularly exercised about the risks of social breakdown in Greece.\n\nUnnamed German government sources told Munich\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that an emergency summit on Greece could be convened in Brussels as early as Friday if the eurozone finance ministers fail to make a breakthrough on Thursday in Luxembourg.\n\n\n\nThe German sources warned of Greek banks being closed down and capital controls imposed over the weekend. Sources in Brussels last night denied there were any plans for an emergency summit this week. \u201cNothing planned. Nothing decided. All eyes on Eurogroup,\u201d said an official in Brussels.\n\n\n\nUnsustainable futures? The Greek pensions dilemma explained Read more\n\n\u201cWe should work out an emergency plan because Greece would fall into a state of emergency,\u201d said Germany\u2019s European commissioner, Guenther Oettinger. \u201cEnergy supplies, pay for police officials, medical supplies, and pharmaceutical products and much more\u201d needed to be ensured, he said.\n\nAthens\u2019s benchmark ATG equity index fell 4.7% on Monday, with the Athens stock exchange FTSE Banks Index down 8%. National Bank of Greece fell 5.7% and Bank of Piraeus dropped 12.2%.\n\nOther European bourses were affected by the gloomy mood. The key German and French share indices were down almost 2%, while the Italian index lost 2.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level in three months, dropping 74 points or 1.1% to close at 6710.52.\n\n\n\n", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00",

Central Bank boss said he was ready to provide more stimulus to prevent the eurozone\u2019s faltering economy being hit by worries over China.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects had suffered in recent months and could worsen if the slowdown in China and turmoil in emerging markets took a turn for the worse.\n\nHe said he expected to have a better sense of the outlook for the Chinese economy after the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank policymakers in Turkey at the weekend, but in the meantime he held open the possibility of pumping further funds into the Europe\u2019s banking system to boost growth.\n\n\u201cWe are observing a weakening of the prospects of the Chinese economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis has two effects substantially. One is through the trade channel, weakening the economies of the rest of the world \u2026 and the confidence effect on the stock market and all the other financial markets, which is also operating on the negative side.\u201d\n\nDraghi\u2019s comments echoed a report earlier this week from the International Monetary Fund that said weakening growth in emerging markets, largely in response to a cut in China\u2019s forecasts, would damage the recovery of the global economy.\n\n\n\nThe IMF said central banks should maintain flows of cheap credit to households and businesses and consider opening the taps further if the global situation deteriorates.\n\nStock markets have gained and lost trillions of dollars in recent weeks as traders wrestle with a stream of dire economic figures from China.\n\nThe data, which included an 8% fall in exports in July, has triggered a series of responses from Beijing that included cutting the value of the yuan and buying the shares of smaller companies on the Shanghai exchange.\n\nDespite the IMF\u2019s caution, the US Federal Reserve meets on 17 September to consider raising its main interest rate. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last weekend that the UK was on track for higher borrowing costs early next year.\n\nDraghi said the G20 summit was an opportunity to find out whether the current downturn was a blip or a more protracted situation. \u201cWe do expect to have much more visibility than we have today in the coming days of the G20 in Ankara. That is going to be one of the major themes of the meetings.\u201d\n\nThe ECB, which kept interest rates on hold, has already started a \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3802bn) government bond-buying programme this year. The quantitative easing (QE) scheme, which involves injecting \u20ac60bn into the banking system each month, is due to end in September 2016, but assets purchases can run for longer if necessary, Draghi said.\n\nThe stimulus is intended to help get consumer price inflation back toward the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. In the year to August, it stood at 0.2%. Draghi said it could go negative in the coming months following recent oil price falls.\n\nThe euro dropped 1% against the dollar and the yen as traders bet on the ECB flooding the eurozone with extra funds in an effort to counteract some of the fallout from Asia.\n\n\n\nStock markets jumped at the prospect of cheap credit and a lower-value euro boosting business profits. The German Dax and French CAC rose by more than 2.5% and the FTSE climbed 110 points to 6194, up 1.8%.\n\nHoward Archer, the chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said Draghi was preparing the ground for further stimulus with his remarks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe door is now clearly wide open to the ECB stepping up its near-term pace of QE and/or increasing its overall size and duration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhether the ECB steps through that door will clearly depend on whether eurozone growth continues to struggle and inflation prospects deteriorate further.\u201d\n\nAndrew Bosomworth, a spokesman for the bond fund manager Pimco, said the ECB was beginning to mimic the Bank of Japan as it struggled to deal with a stagnating economy buffeted by volatile financial markets.\n\n\u201cThe ECB has limited confidence in reaching its inflation objective over the next two years, the policy-relevant time horizon, suggesting more stimulus might be needed.\n\n\u201cWhile the ECB\u2019s QE programme was always open-ended from the start, downside risks to the 2017 inflation forecast raise the likelihood the ECB increases the quantity of bonds it purchases each month from \u20ac60bn or continues QE beyond September next year.\u201d\n\n", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Phillip Inman", "entities": {"Ed Aarons":

perfidious\u201d.\n\nReviewing Vargas Llosa\u2019s new collection of essays Notes on the Death of Culture, an indictment of the west\u2019s obsession with entertainment, novelist Joshua Cohen put the Peruvian writer in the \u201cGrumpy Old Novelists\u201d category, finding that \u201cVargas Llosa\u2019s novels have never hesitated to traffic in the same high-low blend he now bemoans\u201d.\n\nCohen ended his review by pointing out that shortly before Notes on the Death of Culture was published, the novelist \u201cleft his wife of 50 years for Isabel Preysler, a Filipino-born Spanish socialite, model and former beauty queen known as the Pearl of Manila, and as the ex-wife of Julio Iglesias\u201d, adding that Vargas Llosa announced the relationship on Twitter, and sold an \u201cexclusive\u201d story and photographs to Hola!\n\nBut Vargas Llosa, in a letter to the editor, said the write-up \u201ccontains information about me that is both slanderous and perfidious\u201d. \u201cI have never had a Twitter account, and I have never posted and never will post anything on any Twitter account. I have never sold a photo or story to Hola! magazine or any other outlet in connection with any relationship or personal matter,\u201d the author continued. \u201cI am flabbergasted to learn that this kind of gossip can work its way into a respectable publication such as the Book Review.\u201d\n\nThe lines have now been removed from the review, with an editor\u2019s note revealing that \u201cthe reviewer had based his account of these matters mostly on information from an article about Vargas Llosa in The Daily Mail\u201d, that \u201cneither the reviewer nor editors independently verified those statements\u201d, and that \u201cusing such information is at odds with the Times\u2019s journalistic standards\u201d.\n\nVargas Llosa, whose works include The Feast of the Goat (2000) and

will be offloaded on a permanent basis this summer providing a taker can be found. The striker\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, has started sounding out potential suitors for the talented but troubled Italy international and clubs in China and Turkey have expressed interest.\n\nFootball transfer rumours: Wayne Rooney to join Shanghai Shenhua? Read more\n\nLiverpool paid \u00a316m to sign the 25-year-old from Milan in 2014 and he remains under contract at Anfield until 2017, with the club having an option to extend the deal by a year. That is not on the agenda following his minimal contribution under Brendan Rodgers, who ultimately froze out Balotelli from first-team training, and the accepted panic signing continues to cost Liverpool money. The club contribute to the forward\u2019s basic \u00a380,000 weekly wage at Milan.\n\nThe financial hit they are taking on Balotelli, however, would be softened significantly should a permanent transfer to China materialise this summer. The Chinese Super League outspent the Premier League in January and that expenditure, following a declaration by the president, Xi Jingping, that China should become a football powerhouse, has prompted agents such as Raiola and Pini Zahavi to explore further deals for the summer.\n\nRaiola this week denied there were problems between Balotelli, Milan and Sinisa Mihajlovic after the coach indicated the striker would not play for the club again. \u201cThose who don\u2019t sacrifice themselves for the team to the 94th minute will no longer set foot on the field,\u201d Mihajlovic said after a 2-1 win over Genoa. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Balotelli \u2013 there were another two or three as well as him.

Yet, unlike most of these weeks spent kicking around in the international wilderness, widely regarded as an outlier incapable of fulfilling his potential, this time the Balotelli question feels sharply pertinent. Italy\u2019s forward options are not the most inspiring, and a few miles along from the coast of Liguria, in the south of France, Balotelli\u2019s goal blaze is firing the imagination.\n\nThis complex, sometimes maddening, spark of powerful attacking talent has been reignited at Nice. After a couple of fruitless seasons where his career stalled at Liverpool and on loan at Milan, Balotelli has been busy reminding critics why, on ability alone, he should be towards the front of any queues for an attacking berth for his country. It is early days, and the debate still needs to tilt further in his favour, but if his eye-catching start to life in Nice goes on, Giampiero Ventura may have to open the door to a recall for the kid who had it all but somehow lost it along the way.\n\nMario Balotelli bags double and says he can still win Ballon d'Or Read more\n\nBalotelli made positive noises in an interview where he said he understood why he was omitted from the current Italy squad and felt it was deserved. \u201cI hope to return very soon, but only at my best,\u201d he insisted.\n\nVentura\u2019s reaction followed the pattern of managers who have felt compelled to be cautious when it came to the matter of trusting an unpredictable player. \u201cThese remain words,\u201d said Ventura. \u201cAnd I am accustomed to seeing facts. He has a lot of quality, but needs to prove he can play for the team and make the difference within a squad dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe wily old coach expects high standards when it comes to conduct. Graziano Pell\u00e8 was sent home from this World Cup qualification double header after refusing to shake his manager\u2019s hand when he was substituted against Spain, and so left Italy a striker short for Sunday\u2019s game in Macedonia.\n\nBalotelli\u2019s first few weeks in Nice have gone better than almost anyone could have expected. The club had been an excellent choice for Hatem Ben Arfa, another tricky customer who had trouble finding the right environment to express his talent, to relaunch himself. Balotelli flew into Cote d\u2019Azur with his enormous baggage. Was it reasonable to expect another success story in Nice? Not a lot conforms to sound judgment in the world of Balotelli, but he has unpacked, lightened his load, and looks happy again on the field. A goal rush of six from five games has everyone gushing.\n\nIf Balotelli\u2019s arrival on transfer deadline day felt like a marriage of convenience, pretty quickly both sides are looking extremely happy with one another. A club on the rise under new ownership have an exciting prize who is headline news. Balotelli is finding his form, behaving well, and ready to challenge deep-set opinions. \u201cHe can get back on top of the world,\u201d said the club\u2019s manager, Lucien Favre. \u201cYou have to be blind not to see how good he is in front of goal.\u201d There has been variety to his goals too \u2013 the trademark cool penalty, a close-range header, the long-range screamer, a powerful run and clinical finish.\n\nTogether Nice and Balotelli are top of the table. The club are benefitting not only from his presence on the field, but also from the attention. Their man is a cover story every day. They boast a charismatic personality capable of at least trying to saunter into the Zlatan Ibrahimovic-shaped hole. Publicity-wise, as far as the French league is concerned, what Zlatan taketh away, Super Mario giveth. Balotelli is a big part of the show.\n\nThat was crystallised by the reaction to his unfortunate red card having scored a scorching winner against Lorient. A second booking was harsh and the media circus cranked up. Before long the referee released a statement to say he had made a mistake, and even the president of Lyon, who would have benefitted from a banned Balotelli since they meet after the international break, spoke out on the player\u2019s behalf. Balotelli has now had the red card overturned.\n\nIt is interesting that, in an echo of his ill-starred move to Liverpool, Balotelli was courted by the men upstairs rather than the head coach. Favre at first seemed as dubious as Brendan Rodgers was when the Italian was delivered to him at Anfield in 2014. Favre\u2019s message was plain at the start: play well and act professional and you can be part of the squad. Play badly and act up and it will not be indulged.\n\nHaving had so many false restarts, many were doubtful that this Balotelli would be any different from the player who has drifted to frustrating fringes recently. But so far his attitude has been as impressive as his displays. He is not yet fully fit or fully sharp. Favre hopes there is more to come, with the extra training sessions paying off to make him more rounded than a spearhead who is in the right place to bang in goals right now. \u201cHe will get back to his best if he is professional from head to toe,\u201d says the manager.\n\nItaly play Liechtenstein and Germany next month. Balotelli once again has something to aim for.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.4, "magnitude": 0.4}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Amy Lawrence", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type":

Mark Carney\u2019s interest-rate strategy following the Brexit vote.\n\nAndreas Dombret, who sits on the board of the German Bundesbank, told an audience of bankers in London that it was \u201ctime for a friendly reminder that central bank independence is not debatable\u201d.\n\nHe was speaking just days after Carney, governor of the Bank of England, had said he was \u201cnot going to take instruction on our policies from the political side\u201d.\n\nThe governor made his remarks after the prime minister, Theresa May, told Conservative party conference that \u201cordinary working-class people\u201d were being hurt by low interest rates as well as the electronic money printing exercise known as quantitative easing.\n\n\n\nBank of England rebuts May and Hague's attacks on quantitative easing Read more\n\nHours after Dombret delivered his wide-ranging speech to the British Bankers\u2019 Association, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, was asked about May\u2019s remarks as he announced the bank\u2019s latest monetary policy for the eurozone.\n\nDraghi said he did not feel central bank independence was threatened and rebutted May\u2019s criticism about the impact. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel threatened. Neither is the independence of monetary policy by the governing council threatened,\u201d said Draghi. The cause of inequality was not monetary policy but unemployment, he said.\n\nThe former foreign secretary William Hague also waded into the debate about low interest rates, writing in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that savers were finding it \u201cimpossible to earn a worthwhile return\u201d. Lord Hague added: \u201cUnless [central banks] change course soon they will find their independence increasingly under attack.\u201d\n\nDombret said politicians had removed themselves from monetary policy for \u201cvery good\u201d reasons.\n\n\u201cExperience shows that political influence over central banks always leads into disorder. At the end of the day, independent central banks best guarantee price stability. Calling central bank independence into question, even only implicitly, can confuse markets as well as the public about who is in charge when it comes to monetary policy and supervisory decisions.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have seen some criticism of central banks and their policies from politicians lately. This concerned, for example, the handling of Brexit, as well as conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates more generally.\u201d\n\nDombret played down the impact of Brexit on the financial system. \u201cBrexit and its possible repercussions for the City of London are unlikely to be an issue for financial stability or the financing of the EU\u2019s real economy,\u201d he said.\n\nFrance\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, told the conference that Paris was ready to welcome banking business, as Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, warned that banks were getting ready to move. \u201cTheir hands are poised quivering over the relocate button, with the first movements expected in the coming months,\u201d Browne said.\n\nMay has said she intends to trigger article 50 \u2013 the formal mechanism that starts the two-year negotiating period to leave the EU \u2013 in March. However, the Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general, told bankers that this timetable was optimistic as a legal challenge to Brexit could make it necessary for parliament to debate the UK\u2019s exit terms.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Jill Treanor", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-09-21": [{"author": "Tyres screech.

Or my cool ensemble of blue dungarees, tomato-red top and oversized cap. Or maybe it\u2019s my new moustache, dangling limply from my sweaty upper lip.\n\nFor today, and for one day only, just call me Mario. Super Mario, in fact \u2013 gaming icon and the planet\u2019s most-cherished Italian plumber. Over the next three hours I\u2019m touring the neighbourhoods of Tokyo in a pimped-up, road-ready go kart.\n\nHot on the heels of Pokemon Go, coming to a mobile screen near you this December, is Nintendo\u2019s latest game, Super Mario Run. And if, like me, you\u2019re tragically into the characters, you can skid around Tokyo\u2019s sights and streets dressed up as your favourite star.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hannah dressed as Mario and her boyfriend as his sidekick, Luigi\n\nMy boyfriend \u2013 bless his blue and pea-green jumpsuit \u2013 has agreed to ride along as Mario\u2019s sidekick, Luigi. Forget roleplay, we\u2019re all about the cosplay. It\u2019s a thing here. We\u2019re taking a private tour, but group bookings are available: Princess Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong \u2013 the whole crew can join in the fun.\n\nWe begin in suitably \u201cgeeky\u201d Akihabara, where shops are crammed with gadgets and speakers scream out Japanese pop. After a brief safety demo we\u2019re off, our guide Kuzuoka leading, then me, with Luigi at the rear. A group of American tourists stops us at the lights. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be more famous than David Hasselholff,\u201d they shriek.\n\nThe crowds start to descend minutes later.

Cars give us space, and we navigate peaceful back streets.\n\nOn to the big sights, including the one of the world\u2019s busiest junction\u2019s, the famous Shibuya scramble crossing. The lights change and we floor it, nipping beneath the neon-lit buildings to a raucous applause from open-mouthed onlookers.\n\nNext up is Harajuku, the fashion hangout where kookily dressed teens usually pose for pictures. Not today. As we crawl through tree-lined Omotesando Avenue, well-heeled shoppers emerge from Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hugo Boss, whooping as we return their waves.\n\nThe language barrier keeps conversation short and vaguely snappy: \u201cKarting, it tires,\u201d Kuzuoka tells me, via Google Translate on his phone. He\u2019s right. Even my costume can\u2019t hack the pace; as we cross the final flyover my moustache takes off, landing on the windscreen of the car behind.\n\nA fully versed city tour this is not \u2013 but who needs the big sights?

What separates Helldivers from the many games that fit this description is its multiplayer mode, where you get together with up to three chums to take on the game\u2019s baddy-infested wastelands. You\u2019ll need to be careful, though, because your gunfire mows down friends as well as enemies, as do \u201cstratagems\u201d, which is Helldiver jargon for satellite drops that plummet down from orbit at supersonic speeds. There\u2019s also an overarching meta-game that sees you vie for control of planetary systems with your three enemies: the bugs, cyborgs and illuminates. Most of Helldiver\u2019s problems come from players manifestly too weak for the level you\u2019re playing joining in and accidentally shooting you in the back, although playing on your own or with friends fixes that.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment, \u00a316.99\n\nAdVenture Capitalist, iOS\n\nThere are few games that sound more unprepossessing than AdVenture Capitalist.

To guard against a drop in price expectations, \"more pre-emptive action may be warranted\", he said.\n\nDraghi's comments follow suggestions from other ECB policymakers that the bank is ready to act at its policy meeting on 5 June to counter low inflation and weak lending in the 18-country eurozone. Draghi said he expected inflation, which is running at 0.7%, to return slowly to the ECB's target of just under 2%.\n\n\"Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do,\" he said at the ECB's Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. \"What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is, in my view, the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.\"\n\nSetting out policy options for different scenarios, Draghi said that should exchange rate or market developments result in an unwarranted tightening of monetary and financial conditions \"this would require adjustment of our conventional instruments\". Such instruments include interest rate cuts.\n\nThere has been speculation that the ECB could impose negative interest rates in an effort to spur demand and introduce inflationary pressures into the eurozone.\n\nThe ECB is preparing a package of policy options for its June meeting, including cuts in all its interest rates as well as targeted measures aimed at boosting lending to small- and mid-sized firms. Draghi indicated that full-blown, US-style quantitative easing \u2013 printing money to buy assets \u2013 remained an option for the ECB, saying a destabilising of inflation expectations \"would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase programme\".\n\nDraghi also referred to the reluctance of banks in some eurozone countries \u2013 particularly those on the periphery of the bloc \u2013 to issue loans as they repair their balance sheets. The recovery would bring growing demand for credit, Draghi said.\n\n\"And at this point, for monetary policy to produce its full effects there must be no binding constraints on credit supply through the banking system,\" he added.\n\nBut he warned that credit demand may pick up faster than banks can repair their balance sheets and new capital markets can be developed to complement bank lending.\n\n\"If, in this context, availability of term funding is a limiting factor on loan origination, then monetary policy can play a bridging role,\" Draghi said. \"Term-funding of loans, be it on-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through refinancing operations \u2013 or off-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through purchases of asset-backed securities \u2013 could help reduce any drag on the recovery coming from temporary credit supply constraints.\"\n\nThese comments suggested the ECB could deploy a long-term lending facility \u2013 or LTRO \u2013 providing banks with funds to lend on to businesses and households, or buy asset-backed securities (ABS) to support the provision of loans.\n\nECB executive board member Yves Mersch said on Saturday there were signs credit demand in the euro area is beginning to pick up and that banks need to be strong enough to respond to that demand.\n\nDraghi said credit constraints were putting a brake on the recovery in stressed countries while the effects of an appreciating euro exchange rate would hold down eurozone inflation.\n\n\"There is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold,\" he said. \"This may then cause households and firms to defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle.\"\n\nDraghi said after the ECB's May meeting that the governing council was \"comfortable with acting next time\" (at its policy meeting) but wanted to see updated economic projections from the bank's staff first.\n\nSince then data confirmed a slight increase in eurozone inflation in April to 0.7% from 0.5% the previous month, but it

Too much faith, in all likelihood. They rallied last summer when the president of the European Central Bank said he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. And they rallied on Thursday when the ECB cut interest rates to 0.5%. Bond yields fell across the eurozone, hitting record lows in France and dropping below 10% in Greece. Stock markets liked the news, too.\n\nBut did the news warrant the upbeat response? Not really. Let's be clear, the reduction in the cost of borrowing for the eurozone was welcome. It was also signalled in advance, long overdue, and the bare minimum that the ECB could have delivered when recession is deepening quarter by quarter and Japanese-style deflation appears to be just around the corner.\n\nDraghi hinted that the ECB might consider negative deposit rates, which would mean that banks would have to pay for the privilege of parking money at Europe's central bank. That threat, it is hoped, will encourage banks to lend rather than hoard their cash. And he said the ECB would consult with the European Investment Bank and the European commission about the possibility of measures that could boost credit flows to small- and medium-sized companies.\n\nBy no stretch of the imagination does this amount to a rescue plan for a eurozone facing a second calendar year of declining output and with unemployment at a record 12.1% and rising. The Bank of England had its Funding for Lending Scheme in place by the middle of 2012; the ECB is still at the drawing board stage.\n\nThis is perhaps not surprising. The ECB is a conservative institution, although it has become less so under Draghi's stewardship. Its freedom of action is constrained by Germany's insistence that the problems of the troubled countries of the eurozone are caused by the lack of structural reform, and not insufficient demand. It was clear from Draghi's press conference that the decision was not unanimous and it did not take a genius to surmise that Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, was a dissenting voice.\n\nSo why are markets so chipper? We can rule out the idea that the ECB's rate cut will prompt a recovery in output. (Although it may help, at the margin, to underpin consumer and business confidence.) The decline in Greek bond yields suggests that the markets believe the risks of a break-up of the single currency have markedly diminished since Draghi issued his \"whatever it takes\" reassurance in July 2012. The immediate threat to monetary union is certainly diminished, but it is a heroic assumption \u2013 given the deepening slump, the recurrent sovereign debt crises and the structural differences between rich and poor countries \u2013 to imagine that the risk of break-up has disappeared altogether.\n\nNo, what we are really witnessing here is a touching belief in the ability and willingness of central banks to prevent investors suffering losses. In the early part of the last decade there was something known as the Greenspan put: every time Wall Street was in trouble, the chairman of the Federal Reserve would ride to the rescue with a cut in interest rates. In 2013 we have the Bernanke put, the King put and now the Draghi put. Bad economic news is treated by the markets as good economic news, because they believe lower interest rates or more quantitative easing will follow. Eventually one of two things happens: the recovery actually does arrive.

In recent weeks, the data shows growth momentum is slowing down. It is quite clear that if geopolitical risks materialise, the next two quarters will show lower growth.\"\n\nRecovery in the region is barely established, with GDP increasing by only 0.2% in the first quarter of the year.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Frankfurt, Draghi said sanctions and counter sanctions between the west and Russia were among the biggest risks facing the eurozone economy, with the potential to drive energy prices higher and depress exports. He stressed it was too early to say what the precise impact sanctions would have on the region.\n\n\"We are just at the beginning. We are still assessing what impact sanctions might have on the economy.\n\n\"Geopolitical risks are heightened. And some of them, like the situation in Ukraine and Russia will have a greater impact on the euro area than they \u2026 have on other parts of the world.\"\n\nEarlier, the ECB's governing council left rates on hold at its July policy meeting, as expected.\n\nThe Bank delivered a raft of stimulative measures in June, but stopped short of announcing QE to breathe some life into the single currency bloc's economy and stave off the threat of a dangerous deflationary spiral.\n\nEurozone inflation fell to a near five-year low of 0.4% in July, dragged lower by accelerating falls in food, alcohol and tobacco prices, and a sharp drop in energy prices. Deflation is dangerous for economies as it encourages companies to delay spending in the expectation that prices will fall further, creating a spiral of slumping demand and further falls in prices.\n\nThe main interest rate was cut to a record low of 0.15% in June and the deposit rate was cut to -0.1% \u2013 meaning banks have to pay to park cash with the ECB in the hope it will encourage them to lend more to businesses and consumers.\n\nThe central bank also announced a \u20ac400bn (\u00a3317bn) package of cheap funding with the condition that the money is used to lend to companies outside the financial sector, and not for mortgages.\n\nDraghi said on Thursday that those measures announced in June had been \"successful\" so far. He stressed that markets were expecting rates in the eurozone to remain very low for much longer than in the US. The ECB is pumping more stimulus into the eurozone as central banks in the US and the UK prepare to tighten policy.\n\nThe euro weakened against the dollar and the pound after his comments, and Europe's main stock markets were down.\n\nHe said the countries that had undertaken structural reforms were doing better than those that had not undertaken reforms, or those that had undertaken only limited reforms.\n\nHolger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said that recent data had disappointed. \"Despite buoyant leading indicators, an easing of austerity and some lessening of the peripheral credit crunch, the economy now seems to be expanding more slowly than in mid-2013.\"\n\nItaly slipped back into recession this week, the French economy is flat, and Schmieding said Germany's economy might have contracted slightly in the second quarter after growth of 0.8% in the first three months of the year.\n\nEscalating tensions in Russia threaten to weigh on business confidence and exports in Germany particularly \u2013 Russia's largest trading partner in the European Union.\n\nThe weakening outlook for Italy and Germany prompted Berenberg to downgrade its eurozone growth forecast from 1% to 0.8% in 2014, and from 1.6% to 1.4% in 2015.\n\nThe first official estimate for eurozone growth in the second quarter will be published next week by the EU's statistics office, Eurostat.\n\nDraghi said the action taken to prevent the collapse of Portugal's Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was \"swift and effective\" and played down the suggestion that it was a worrying sign that there were still deep problems lurking in the eurozone's banking system that could plunge the region back into a full-blown crisis.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1},

European Central Bank, has stunned markets by signalling that he is prepared to cut interest rates and step up quantitative easing to stave off the risk of a renewed economic slump in the eurozone.\n\nThe value of the single currency dropped sharply on foreign exchanges on Thursday as Draghi announced that the ECB\u2019s governing council had discussed expanding its \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3795bn) bond-buying programme and cutting the rate on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nThis \u201cdiscount rate\u201d is already negative, at -0.2%, meaning banks effectively have to pay the ECB for holding their reserves \u2013 a measure aimed at keeping money flowing around the economy.\n\nSpeaking after the ECB\u2019s latest policy meeting in Malta, Draghi revealed that some members of the governing council had favoured taking more action to stimulate the economy immediately. He blamed the slowdown in emerging markets, including China, for renewed weakness in the eurozone.\n\n\u201cWhile euro area domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and possible repercussions for the economy from developments in financial and commodity markets continue to signal downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation,\u201d he said in his opening statement.\n\nDraghi said the ECB could also step up the scale of QE. A decision is likely to be made at the December meeting of its governing council, when its latest economic forecasts will be available. As Draghi spoke, the euro dropped by 1.5 cents against the dollar, to $1.117.\n\n\u201cThe governing council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, if warranted, in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nHe added that he and his ECB colleagues would not be in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode, but rather \u201cwait and assess\u201d mode, between now and their policy meeting on 3 December.\n\n\u201cThe ECB will almost certainly be delivering an early Christmas present this year,\u201d said Nick Kounis, the head of markets and macro research at investment bank ABN Amro.\n\nDraghi is an enthusiastic proponent of \u201cforward guidance\u201d, the strategy of sending strong verbal policy signals in order to shift financial markets \u2013 in this case, driving down the euro.\n\nHis dramatic pledge in the summer of 2012 \u2013 in the middle of the Greek debt crisis \u2013 that the ECB would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the single currency helped to reassure panic-stricken investors.\n\nJeremy Cook, the chief economist of international payments company World First, said ECB policymakers were likely to have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the strengthening of the currency, which makes eurozone goods less competitive on international markets.\n\n\u201cDraghi and the executive council couldn\u2019t have been clearer that additional policy easing was coming if they\u2019d had the words \u2018sell the euro\u2019 tattooed on their faces,\u201d he said.\n\nEuro area GDP rose 0.4% in the second quarter of 2015, a slight slowdown from 0.5% growth in the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, a stream of downbeat data from Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, including the sharpest decline in exports in six years, has stoked fears about a downturn.\n\nGermany readies itself for more woe as scandal and slowdown hit economy Read more\n\nThere are also concerns that the repercussions of the emissions-fixing scandal at German carmaker Volkswagen, one of the pillars of its industrial sector, could undermine the strength of the economy. Asked about the potential impact of events at VW, Draghi said: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very early to say.\u201d\n\nDraghi\u2019s comments about the possibility of reducing the discount rate further below zero will also rekindle debate about whether borrowing costs could eventually be pushed lower in the UK, where the base rate has been at 0.5% since March 2009.\n\n\n\nAndy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has argued that a rate cut might eventually be necessary, but other Bank insiders believe there is little to be gained when rates are already so close to zero.\n\nJennifer McKeown of consultancy Capital Economics predicted that the ECB would step up the pace of bond purchases in December, perhaps to \u20ac80bn a month from \u20ac60bn currently, and could also extend the QE programme beyond its planned end date of September 2016.\n\nShe argued that this could significantly weaken the value of the euro as the US Federal Reserve prepares to tighten monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWith US interest rates still set to increase next year, the prospect of a substantial divergence of monetary policy between the eurozone and the US implies downside risks for the euro versus the US dollar.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Heather Stewart", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON",

The boss of the European Central Bank (ECB) may have failed earlier this year to slay the dragon of deflation when he launched \u20ac60bn (\u00a343bn) a month of quantitative easing, but his policy worked to some degree and in any case, his weapons are ineffectual for now .\n\nThe City loves cheap credit and is cheering on Draghi to cut interest rates or boost the QE programme, based on the time-honoured theory that central bankers with loose monetary policies can prevent their economies slipping into negative inflation.\n\nMario Draghi: ECB prepared to cut interest rates and expand QE Read more\n\nSuch a move would increase the supply of money inside the single currency bloc and supposedly add to the pressure on prices. Inflation would stabilise. Deflation killed.\n\nWhen eurozone prices slipped back 0.1% last month, the clamour from investors intensified. And when it seemed as if Draghi was amenable, stock markets jumped. They obliged again on Thursday with the German Dax soaring by more than 250 points, or 2.5%.\n\nExcept that the ECB has little firepower left. Inflation is low because oil prices have collapsed since last year. If anything, this is a good thing for consumers and businesses that have more disposable income.\n\nTo a great extent, the direction of oil prices lies in the hands of US frackers. If they declare their wells uneconomic at $50 (\u00a332) a barrel and shut them down, supply will fall and prices rise. If they continue pumping, prices will stay low.\n\nAs for pumping money into the eurozone economy, that task is being taken up by the Spanish and Italian governments.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Rome and Madrid have submitted budgets to spend more than the EU commission considers prudent. It is this cash that will boost spending over the next year more than an extra \u20ac10bn from the ECB.\n\nAnd yet Draghi just might press the button. He might even push down the already negative deposit rate \u2013 the one that effectively charges banks to park money with the ECB \u2013 if only because he cares about the exchange rate, which is threatening to choke off the eurozone recovery.\n\nThe euro has recently approached $1.15 compared with its near 12-year low of $1.0457 in March. That\u2019s a big burden for Italian and German exporting manufacturers to carry at a time when China is slowing and world trade contracting.\n\nDraghi will always deny the ECB has an exchange-rate target. Yet he did acknowledge the significance of the exchange rate to growth and the risk that, without further action, the euro will carry on rising.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Phillip Inman", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}]], "2016-10-24": [{"author": "Paper Mario Color Splash\n\nWii U, Nintendo; cert: 3\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPaper Mario Color Splash is the fifth entry in Nintendo\u2019s comedy action-RPG series, after the paper-craft aesthetic and card-based combat established in the disappointing Sticker Star. However, thanks to the witty writing and imaginative locales, it\u2019s a vast improvement on that uncharacteristically bland 3DS game. Indeed, Color Splash constantly pokes fun at Mario tropes with self-aware humour and memorably goofy set pieces.\n\nThe battles, though, are still slow and laborious. They demand too many needless inputs while offering little in the way of skill or strategy. Plus, the random card distribution often leaves players with the wrong tools.\n\nOutside of battle, the painting mechanic is a much more satisfying means of interacting with the beautifully stylised game world. Though far from perfect, Color Splash is a definite step in the right direction and goes a long way toward overcoming its shortfalls with some good old-fashioned heart.

An odd start to a game that boasts an even odder protagonist \u2013 a recently deceased septuagenarian trapped in purgatory, searching for her husband\u2019s spirit with only a scouse dragon on tech support for assistance. Stranger still, forces are arraying to prevent Doris\u2019s passage through the afterlife. The peculiar scenario is central to Doris and the Dragon\u2019s charms and as this retro-style, point-and-click adventure progresses, the hook keeps your attention in spite of some truly wretched voice acting. It is to be hoped that this will improve in later chapters of this episodic title.\n\nPuzzles range from simple to mindbending to broken, where solving in the wrong order seems to block further progression. However, the game\u2019s sensitive exploration of death and life make this an unexpectedly profound entry in the genre. The excessively blocky pixel art style won\u2019t be for everyone, even those who remember the likes of the original King\u2019s Quest games, but the tone and challenge make for a great experience.

Masquerada rejects this somewhat monotone palette and crafts an engrossing world full of magic, heroes and complicated politics inspired by Europe\u2019s medieval history.\n\nBlending comic book visuals and faux cel shading, it transports players to the beautiful Citte della Ombre, where civil war brews between magic-hoarding aristocrats and the abandoned underclass. As the once-exiled Cicero Gavar, you guide a team of Masquerada \u2013 those who channel elemental sorcery through ancient masks dubbed \u201cMasquerines\u201d \u2013 through an entrancing story, investigating a missing noble while confronting the prejudice of their society.\n\nIn battle, elements can be combined \u2013 apply fire and water to create steam, for instance \u2013 while characters\u2019 positions on the field can tip the balance.

But with some unhappy about the price of the iOS exclusive app we asked readers what they really think of the game.\n\n\n\n\u2018Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5\n\nThe inability to run backwards is often quite frustrating. With previous Super Mario games it\u2019s fun to explore each level to make sure you\u2019ve covered all ground. Because Mario is running forward continuously, it feels like you\u2019re running past hidden features. I think it\u2019s more a game for the busy commuter who likes to pass the time by fiddling with their iPhone. It only really requires half your attention; I feel as though Nintendo deliberately tapped into that market to get people who don\u2019t normally play games to download the app. But you can\u2019t help but question how much you\u2019re really \u2018playing\u2019 the game when you\u2019re merely tapping the screen.\n\n\n\nYou can actually leave Mario up to his own devices for a while and he\u2019ll do his own thing. It would be the perfect game for zombies. Apart from that the look of the game is awesome. It\u2019s very sleek and shiny and looks especially good on an iPad Air screen, much better than Super Mario on the 3DS. I think it\u2019s great that they\u2019re developing games as an app; you can basically choose your own hardware now.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t believe people are upset that they\u2019ve had to pay 8 quid to then discover they don\u2019t like it, especially considering they get the first three levels for free. Because it\u2019s an app they feel they are entitled to it for nothing. My advice is, if you don\u2019t think you can face the disappointment of not liking it, don\u2019t buy it. Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions.\n\n\n\nJonathan Chadwick, Sydney\n\n\u2018Slick, charming, and well-produced\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5\n\nNintendo have a long, celebrated history of creating and perfecting platform games, so it comes as no surprise that Super Mario Run has the tight mechanics and precision-based jumping that we\u2019ve come to expect from the world\u2019s most famous gaming mascot.\n\n\n\nAt a price of \u00a37.99, they have exceeded what the casual mobile gamer is willing to pay for on-the-go entertainment. Additionally, it\u2019s only playable with an internet connection, which seems like a ludicrous caveat when you\u2019ve already paid almost \u00a38.\n\n\n\nThe game itself is a slick, charming, and well-produced endless runner that is playable with one hand. The level-design is fantastic; each of the 24 stages has been crafted to be re-playable with harder difficulties in the shape of collectible coloured coins. I happily repeated the same levels several times, trying to figure out the exact route I needed to take, and when executed correctly it felt very rewarding. Super Mario Run is a polished, meticulously designed, and ultimately fun mobile title that does more than just appeal to nostalgia. However, it comes at a price that many casual gamers will find hard to justify.\n\nZia Murad, Dubai\n\n\u2018I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\nI think the one hand operation is good. Most people dislike that Mario moves automatically, but I think this makes the game more challenging - like getting pink coins or grey coins. Most people just play the first three levels and stop, but I think the game just gets started from that point! I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast =(\n\n\n\nFor 9.99 the price is a bit high. It would be great if it was a free game but a one time payment is fine. It would be better if there was more of a social aspect, mini game option, or even the ability to battle with friends.\n\n\n\nM, Hong Kong\n\n\u2018My favourite thing about the game is they let me pay for it\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nNintendo has built a Mario game that feels like a Mario game, but is not hampered by the limits of a mobile. Mario looks like Mario, sounds like Mario, and most importantly for a Mario game jumps like Mario. Unlike an endless runner the stages are handcrafted, built to provide a modest challenge with precise positioning of coins, blocks, and enemies. The challenge of collecting five specific coloured coins drives you to retry each stage multiple times, and when you succeed, the five coins will be placed elsewhere.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a great game for a quick dip in and out of. A run takes mere moments which is perfect. It handles wonderfully, one thumb touch which does everything you want it to do. The design choice of having a chunk of unused space at the bottom of the screen means that unlike most mobile games I never feel like my touching the screen gets in the way of seeing the action. But my favourite thing about Super Mario Run: they let me pay for it. A one off payment unlocks everything I need. There is nothing pushing me to drop more money to buy new lives, or buy gems which are needed to purchase levels or anything like that. A one off \u00a38 payment for a quality game single handedly solves every problem I\u2019ve had with other mobile games. I look forward to completing it during the excessive loading times when fast travelling in Final Fantasy XV.\n\n\n\nJohn Price, Plymouth\n\n\u2018Terrible marketing\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 2.5 out of 5\n\nPaying 10 bucks after a few levels is terrible marketing. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve checked out popular games but the money comes in the items not the actual gameplay. If I have to pay 99 cents for a special move, fine, but I shouldn\u2019t have to pay money to play the next level.\n\nSullivan, Brooklyn\n\n\u2018A crafted product with depth and replay value\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nI can\u2019t get my head around the negative reaction to this game. Its easily worth \u00a37.99 in my opinion. You play the first three levels, then decide if you want to pay - seems perfectly reasonable to me. I don\u2019t know why so many people expected to play the whole game for free.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t your average iOS shovel-ware - it\u2019s a crafted product with depth and replay value. On one hand it concerns me that people don\u2019t seem to be able to tell the difference - on the other, I suppose this is an inherent risk when aiming a product at the mass market. Yesterday, I spent \u00a36.50 for two coffees and a slice of shortcake, and \u00a37.99 for Super Mario Run. I know which purchase I think was better value.\n\n\n\nDani Thomas, Cardiff\n\n\n\n\u2018Mario for the modern world\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 5 out of 5\n\nSuper Mario Run is a seemingly simple, yet deceptively complex mobile version of a gaming legend. The auto-run-forward of the portly plumber detracts nothing from the side scrolling platform action, instead allowing more attention to be paid to the at times frustrating pixel perfect jump. Speaking of pixels, the graphics are detailed and hi-res enough to satisfy modern eyes.\n\n\n\nThe Nintendo charm is ever present throughout and fans of Mario will be pleased with the look and tone of the package. Yes, the package. People bemoaned the \u00a37.99 charge upon reaching the first Koopa confrontation. However, in my opinion there is enough to satisfy. Six worlds, three levels and a boss battle in each. There\u2019s also a road rally which shifts the emphasis of the platforming action to style over course completion and enemy squashing. This leads to village building and toad pleasing mini games. There\u2019s more than enough here to justify eight quid and it\u2019s a few notches above other mobile gaming fare as well, as like it or lump it, Nintendo are still masters of the video game. This is Mario for the modern world. Quick bursts on the loo, on the tram/train/bus, while you wait for your wife to look through the whole shop and for some, while they walk around narrowly avoiding lampposts. Buy it. Enjoy it.\n\nTony Johnson, Manchester", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Rachel Obordo", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-07-11": [{"author": "The Mill never thought it would come to this.

Rather than racing for the goal, players compete for stars on a dice roll that determines minigames by the space you land on.\n\nBowser Party does shake things up, pitting a team of four players on the TV screen against a rampant King Bowser on the Wii U gamepad in asymmetric multiplayer, and Amiibo Party utilises Nintendo\u2019s smart figures on a series of unique but sadly simplistic Amiibo boards.

He told us he had changed his ways. Mario Balotelli told us all the words he thought we might want to hear as he rejoined Milan on loan this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give everything.\u201d At one point, he even informed Gazzetta dello Sport that: \u201cI used to be a boy named Mario, but now I\u2019m Mario the man.\u201d\n\nIf he sounded like a spurned lover trying to win back a lost partner\u2019s approval, then perhaps that\u2019s exactly what he was. Balotelli had adored Milan since he was a child, and was not the first to frame their relationship in romantic terms. Adriano Galliani announced the striker\u2019s imminent return last August by telling reporters: \u201cSome loves never end.\u201d\n\nThe Rossoneri\u2019s chief executive is notorious for his willingness to rekindle old affairs. Such players as Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Kak\u00e1 and Roberto Donadoni have departed the club under his stewardship, only to return later in their careers. None have ever recaptured anything like their best form during their second stints with the team.\n\nJuventus restore three-point lead at top with win over Atalanta Read more\n\nSo why bother with Balotelli? He had never sparkled as brightly as the aforementioned stars in the first instance. His strike rate for Milan was robust \u2013 with 26 goals scored in 43 league appearances \u2013 and yet he had faded following a brilliant initial six-month spell. It was Balotelli who salvaged a third-place finish for Milan after joining in January 2013, but he too who collected 10 yellow cards and one red while cutting a tetchy and isolated figure during the following campaign.\n\nSince then, he had endured a dismal year at Liverpool \u2013 scoring only a single Premier League goal and falling behind Rickie Lambert in the pecking order. Milan fans were not exactly agitating for his return. In fact, there were whistles at San Siro when Balotelli\u2019s name was announced among the substitutes for the home opener against Empoli.\n\nBut there was some method to Galliani\u2019s madness. Balotelli, unlike those previous high-profile returnees, was still in his mid-20s. Besides, this was only a loan with no fee attached. In effect, Milan were getting a risk-free trial of a player they had sold for \u00a316m a year earlier, and whose best seasons could still lie ahead.\n\nThe club\u2019s new manager, furthermore, had an existing relationship with Balotelli. Sinisa Mihajlovic had been an assistant at Inter back when the player was emerging from the Nerazzurri\u2019s youth team. A private meeting was arranged between them before Milan signed off on the deal.\n\n\u201cYou will need to be the first to arrive and the last to leave,\u201d Mihajlovic was reported to have told Balotelli. \u201cYou must always give your all, otherwise I will make sure you find your suitcases waiting outside the gates of Milanello.\u201d\n\nBalotelli seemed to have taken that message on board. He put in a swashbuckling cameo off the bench during a derby defeat to Inter before marking his first start with a fine free-kick goal to open the scoring in a 3-2 win over Udinese.\n\nJust when his star was in the ascendancy, though, he was sidelined by a sports hernia. The injury, which turned out to require an operation, took Balotelli out of action from September right through to mid-January.\n\nWhen Balotelli returned, he discovered that he was no longer needed. After a difficult first half to the season, Mihajlovic had finally found an attacking partnership that worked, M\u2019Baye Niang\u2019s range and readiness to drift out and serve crosses from either flank making him the perfect foil to Carlos Bacca\u2019s penalty-box prowling.\n\nMilan went nine games without defeat, surging back into the race for European places. Where once Balotelli asked \u201cWhy always me?\u201d now he was instead left to ponder \u201cWhy never me?\u201d He averaged fewer than 13 minutes on the pitch in his first eight league games back from injury, and failed to record a single goal or assist.\n\nMihajlovic was unsympathetic to suggestions that Balotelli required more substantial opportunities to make an impact. \u201cThe number of minutes you have on the pitch do not matter,\u201d said the manager. \u201cYou can be decisive even in five. He needs to show me that he has rage and desire.\u201d\n\nThat final sentiment was the important one. Introduced for the dying moments of a 2-1 win over Genoa, Balotelli had been asked to lead the defensive effort from the front but never broke out of a jog. Only a late intervention from Milan\u2019s athletic trainer, Antonio Bovenzi, kept a furious Mihajlovic from storming over to make an example of his striker at full-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sinisa Mihajlovic said Mario Balotelli is not yet fully fit. Photograph: Elisabetta Baracchi/EPA\n\nAnd yet, after Niang damaged his ankle in a car accident last week, it was Balotelli to whom the manager turned. He was not necessarily the most obvious choice. J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez, Milan\u2019s leading scorer in 2014-15, has spent most of this season recovering from a hernia of his own but started alongside Balotelli in the Coppa Italia semi-final second leg against Alessandria on Tuesday. The Frenchman hit a pair of goals during what became a 5-0 rout.\n\nBalotelli grabbed one \u2013 just as he had done in the reverse fixture \u2013 but his performance again lacked dynamism or verve. Several newspapers identified him as the worst player in a red-and-black shirt.\n\nMihajlovic persisted, selecting Balotelli to start alongside Bacca in Sunday\u2019s match away to Sassuolo. Unlike third-tier Alessandria, these opponents were strong enough to give Milan real concerns. Just six points behind the Rossoneri at kick-off, Sassuolo had won both home editions of this fixture since their promotion to the top-flight in 2013.\n\nThey would soon make it three out of three. After taking the lead through a beautifully taken goal from Alfred Duncan in the 27th minute, Sassuolo never looked at risk of getting pegged back. Nicola Sansone made the score 2-0 under controversial circumstances late on, his team-mate Davide Biondini fortunate not to have been penalized for a foul on Andrea Bertolacci in the buildup, but Milan\u2019s legitimate complaints over that incident could not mask their own shortcomings in attack.\n\nBalotelli and Bacca never looked in sync as a partnership, the former failing to occupy wide spaces and deliver crosses as Niang might. If the lack of cohesion was understandable, given the two players\u2019 scant experience of playing together, then Balotelli\u2019s indifferent body language and failure to impose himself on his own terms were harder to justify. He did not touch the ball once in Sassuolo\u2019s penalty area, and was subbed off in the 55th minute.\n\nHis replacement, M\u00e9nez, did not fare much better. Mihajlovic claimed afterwards that neither player is yet at full fitness, but that argument is becoming harder to swallow. Almost two months have gone by since Balotelli made his first post-injury appearance, against Fiorentina. This was the first league match he had started since then, and also the first one Milan have lost.\n\nWe cannot blame his struggles on extra-curricular distractions. With the exception of one crude gesture made towards Napoli supporters who gathered outside Milan\u2019s hotel to abuse him last month, Balotelli\u2019s behaviour has been beyond reproach. He has kept his head down, stayed out of the gossip columns and adhered diligently to clauses Milan inserted into his contract governing conduct, social media use and even personal grooming.\n\nBut the cold truth is that he has achieved little on the pitch so far to convince Milan that this relationship was worth reviving. He has only 10 games left in which to do so, and is unlikely to play in all of those unless his performances sharpen up swiftly.\n\nBalotelli may feel frustrated by the timing of his hernia, which cost him momentum at a time when the picture was beginning to look a little more positive. He would not be the first lonely heart, though, to discover that the success or failure of any love affair can come down to a matter of timing.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 No change at the top, with Juventus maintaining their three-point lead over Napoli after both teams won. The Partenopei will be happy to have Gonzalo Higua\u00edn back among the goals after recent overblown reactions to the striker going four games without one. Nobody was more culpable on that front, of course, than Napoli\u2019s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who suggested that Higua\u00edn needed to lose a kilo and a half in order to get back to his early season form. Was there more to such a comment than a clumsy attempt to motivate a star player? Knowing De Laurentiis, you certainly would not bet against it. He has been at loggerheads with Higua\u00edn for some time over the player\u2019s refusal to extend a contract which runs to 2018, and there was a whiff here of the public criticisms he levelled against Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani before they were each sold to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluigi Buffon has not let in a Serie A goal for 836 minutes. Photograph: Giorgio Perottino/Reuters\n\n\u2022 Another clean sheet for Gigi Buffon, who has now gone 836 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, making his the third-longest such streak in the history of the Italian top flight. The only players left to overtake are Dino Zoff, who lasted 903 minutes in 1972-73, and Sebastiano Rossi, who went 929 minutes for Milan in 1993-94. It is no foregone conclusion that Buffon will catch them; next up for Juventus are Sassuolo, who have won three straight. The Old Lady wobbled for a spell against Atalanta on Sunday, and there was a period - before Mario Lemina put the game beyond doubt with this excellent goal - when even the victory was looking far from secure at 1-0.\n\n\u2022 Could Roma yet have a say in the title race? An eight point gap to leaders Juventus will not be easily bridged, but Luciano Spalletti\u2019s side have at least established themselves as the next challenger in line behind Napoli after blowing away Fiorentina on Friday. The Giallorossi have now won seven straight in the league and the pace of Mohamed Salah and Stephan El Shaarawy only looked more devastating this week with Diego Perotti pulling the strings in a No10 role.\n\n\u2022 The relegation scrap just got a whole lot tighter, with only one point separating Palermo and Frosinone after the Sicilians lost to Inter and the Canarini won at home to Udinese. Where Palermo are without a win in seven matches, Frosinone have won half of their last six.\n\n\u2022 Verona, though, might be finished after they were thrashed 3-0 at home to Sampdoria - who are finally putting some distance (or, at the least, some more teams) between themselves and the relegation zone.\n\nResults: Atalanta 0-2 Juventus, Bologna 0-0 Carpi, Frosinone 2-0 Udinese, Genoa 1-0

[{"author": "Mario Draghi rejected the International Monetary Fund's call for immediate action to combat growing deflationary pressures as the European Central Bank adopted a wait-and-see approach to fresh measures to boost growth.\n\nDespite warnings from the fund and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the risks to the eurozone's fragile recovery, the ECB president said it was still thinking about whether to embrace the unconventional approach to monetary policy used by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.\n\nA House of Lords committee has added its voice to those of the IMF and OECD , warning that it would be unwise to conclude that the storm had passed. The eurozone is in the early stages of a recovery from a triple-dip recession, but a report from the Lords economic and financial affairs committee warned that the pick-up was fragile.\n\nThe euro fell on the foreign exchanges after Draghi said the ECB's ruling council had discussed how to implement quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 the purchase of financial assets to create money \u2013 after news this week that the annual inflation rate in the 18-nation eurozone had fallen to just 0.5%.\n\nFinancial analysts said Draghi was playing for time and hoping to stimulate exports by \"talking down\" the euro. Draghi attacked the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, after she made the case for immediate QE.\n\n\"The IMF has been of recent extremely generous in its suggestions on what we should do or not do, and we are really thankful for that,\" he said.\n\n\"Frankly, I would like the IMF to be as generous as they have been towards us also with other monetary policy jurisdictions, like for example issuing statements just the day before a [US Federal Reserve] meeting would take place.\"\n\nDespite speculation ahead of yesterday's meeting, the ECB left its key policy rate at 0.25% and declined to take steps that might increase the flow of credit to businesses and households.\n\nConcern among some on the ECB council about the threat of a prolonged period of Japanese-style deflation was highlighted by the admission that QE \u2013 once considered outside the bank's remit \u2013 was now on the table.\n\n\"All instruments that fall within the mandate, including QE, are intended to be part of this statement,\" Draghi said. He added that all members of the governing council were \"unanimous in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation\".\n\nTrevor Greetham, of Fidelity, said: \"ECB president Mario Draghi says the governing council is open to 'unconventional ease' if necessary in order to avoid an overly long period of low inflation or to offset economic problems caused by currency strength or geopolitical risk [a nod to Putin].\n\n\"This is more monetary policy on the cheap. The aim is to talk down the euro without actually doing anything.\"\n\nThe OECD said the eurozone was returning to growth amid easing austerity and rising confidence but warned that the improvement remained fragile, with high unemployment and risks posed internally and from outside the currency bloc.\n\n\"The euro area economies, including those most heavily hit by the crisis, appear to be turning the corner after many years of low and uneven growth,\" it said in its latest economic survey of the region.\n\nThe OECD said it was forecasting growth of 1% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2015, following a 0.4% fall in gross domestic product in 2013. It stressed that the eurozone's 11.9% jobless rate would not start to come down until next year.\n\n\"The risks to these projections have become more balanced but are still on the downside. Downside risks include the uncertain political situation, social tensions and still challenging public finances in many countries which mean that financial market turbulence could flare up again.\"\n\nIn its report, the Lords committee said: \"It would be unwise to conclude that the storm has passed.\" It noted that fundamental weaknesses still existed, such as poor growth, huge differences in prosperity between member states, \"destructively high\" levels of unemployment and growing fears of a deflationary spiral. These weaknesses left the eurozone extremely vulnerable to future shocks.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2015-07-09": [{"author": "Official photographs taken by the photographer Mario Testino at the christening of Princess Charlotte have been released by Kensington Palace.\n\nThe pictures range from a formal family portrait to more intimate images of the infant with her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, her father, Prince William, and her brother, Prince George.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince George and Prince William.

Still less that, over 30 years later, he would be able to let any old gamer emulate his development process (albeit with vastly superior tools than the ones he had in 1985), while melding the most venerable gameplay with a truly 21st-century gaming phenomenon. But that\u2019s what Super Mario Maker does: by giving gamers the means to create their own Super Mario courses, it enters the realms of user-generated content alongside the stunningly successful likes of Minecraft and LittleBigPlanet.\n\nSuper Mario Maker gently eases you into your quest to become the new Miyamoto, with a half-built course that you must jazz up simply by painting new elements on the screen of the Wii U\u2019s Gamepad, using the stylus. You can add various blocks, either vanilla or containing power-ups and rewards, enemies such as goombas, trampolines, pipes and so on. Then, using the so-called Coursebot, you can name your creation (the game carefully explains that an interesting name can attract a much bigger audience) and publish it for all to play. Although, sensibly, you aren\u2019t allowed to publish it until you\u2019ve completed a play-through \u2013 it\u2019s dead easy to make courses that are physically impossible to negotiate.\n\nAt first, there\u2019s plenty of potential for embarrassment, when you realise that perhaps your level-design skills aren\u2019t quite yet on a par with those of Miyamoto, and what you\u2019ve posted for others to play is not going to change the face of gaming at a stroke. But Coursebot, mercifully, lets you delete your juvenilia, and as you persist, you will undergo a number of small realisations about what constitutes a good side-scrolling 2D platform level.\n\nYou will, however, have to demonstrate a certain amount of persistence when you start playing Super Mario Maker. That\u2019s because, rather than giving you the full palette of course-design elements right away, it starts you off with a very limited set, then drip-feeds a daily selection of new ones, after monitoring how much time you\u2019ve spent playing the game. This is somewhat frustrating: a walk-before-you-can-run approach is all well and good but, from the off, you can download vast amounts of courses that others have created, full of exotic elements like doors, Boos, lava and platforms that move along carefully delineated paths, but you can\u2019t properly edit those levels until you\u2019ve played Super Mario Maker long enough to have acquired those elements.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest After three decades of Mario games, Nintendo is inviting players to create their own levels in the bouncy plumber\u2019s homeland. Photograph: AP\n\nStill, that approach does at least focus you on the basics of designing Super Mario levels, which can only be a good thing. And cute touches abound. You can re-skin your mini-masterpieces at the touch of an icon \u2013 initially, you\u2019re given the classic Super Mario Bros art-style, along with that of New Super Mario Bros U, but there are countless others to acquire, taking you through some of the more obscure historical iterations of the game. Every art style has an underground variation, so you can instantly make sub-levels, accessible via pipes. Underwater and boss levels are possible, and hooking up amiibos gives you exotic, non-standard Mario power-ups. The fact that, unlike Miyamoto himself, Super Mario Maker owners are free from the tyranny of having to make coherent, structured games means that there\u2019s already an awful lot of wild and inventive experimentation on show. Although you are still encouraged to make whole worlds, consisting of groups of four levels.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve played Super Mario Maker enough to unlock everything (a process that takes the best part of a week), something of a step-change occurs, and you can get busy busting the Mario conventions that have stood for three decades. But if your skills do prove a tad deficient, Super Mario Maker still has plenty to offer. Course World is a giant repository of user-generated levels, and you can opt to take the 100 Mario Challenge, which picks sets of eight courses and gives you 100 lives with which to reach the end \u2013 not as generous as it may sound, since difficulty levels tend towards the fearsome. A 10 Mario Challenge offers a similar experience, but with tightly selected levels that showcase some of the more outlandish forms of gameplay that Super Mario Maker supports, and are designed to get your creative juices running. Plus you can dive into any random level in Course World that sounds appealing, or sample anything made by particular individuals who have impressed you.\n\nOnce you overcome the initial frustration engendered by Super Mario Maker\u2019s refusal to give you all its tools at once, it provides a wondrously moreish experience that will enthral a generation of tinkerers. Much as a generation of young teens has been enthralled by Minecraft. And as anything you create in Super Mario Maker will appeal to people older than 15, as well as plenty who are younger, it offers a great progression for Minecrafters who have honed their design skills, yet are starting to feel like one-trick ponies. If it throws up a whole new generation of Miyamotos, it will go down as one of the most significant games in history.\n\nViewed purely as a game, it\u2019s a curiosity, lacking appeal to those who demand instant action. But it is surely destined to become known as a cult-classic, and it will be interesting to see if it fuels a spike in Wii U sales.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Steve Boxer", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2015-09-30": [{"author": "A slump in oil prices pushed eurozone inflation below zero this month, according to figures from Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.\n\nPrices fell across the currency bloc by 0.1% year-on-year in September, putting pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to beef up the \u20ac60bn a month stimulus programme begun earlier this year.\n\nEnergy prices acted as the biggest drag on prices after a fall by 8.9% year-on-year in September.\n\nMario Draghi, the ECB president, hinted recently that more stimulus measures could be needed to boost confidence and growth in the eurozone if there was a further drop in prices.

repeatedly cited this year \u2013 a self-perpetuating decline in prices that occurs across a wide range of goods and services.\u201d\n\nA report by the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s argued that eurozone growth would likely remain steady despite the diminishing prospects for exports, dampened by the rising value of the euro and a slowdown in China that has spread to emerging markets.\n\nJean-Michel Six, Standard & Poor\u2019s chief economist for Europe, said: \u201cAs emerging market currencies have declined, the euro has begun to appreciate again, complicating the ECB\u2019s QE programme, meant to jumpstart eurozone growth and lift inflation expectations.\n\n\u201cThese two weaknesses point to a continuation of QE beyond September 2016, as by then inflation will still be well under the ECB\u2019s target of \u2018close to\u2019 2%.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Phillip Inman", "entities": {"Ed

Tuesday that the meeting had been called off.\n\nNo new date was given for the meeting of the group of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS), which was due to discuss rules that

in clinching agreement have been simmering for some time, but in a speech last month Ingves had said the committee was on track to finalise the reforms, known as Basel III, by the end of

ease deflation fears\n\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has helped calm jittery financial markets by saying he would not hesitate to take fresh action to boost eurozone growth and inflation.\n\nStock markets across Europe, which were already rallying after a turbulent start to 2016, ended the day sharply higher in the belief Draghi would deliver on his pledge at the ECB meeting next month.\n\nFinancial markets believe Draghi will respond to fears of deflation and volatile share prices by pushing interest rates into negative territory and expanding the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme.\n\nDraghi has financial markets hoping bad news is really good news Read more\n\nDraghi dropped the broadest of hints in testimony to the European parliament that further stimulus was imminent. \u201cThe ECB is ready to do its part,\u201d he said, adding that the bank was looking at the low level of inflation and whether enough money was getting through from the banks to the eurozone economy.\n\n\u201cIf either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nHe was speaking after the Chinese stock market opened for the first time in five days, during which global financial markets were rocked by fears of a rerun of the 2008 banking crisis. It held steady, helped by a 7% increased in Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, which posted its second-biggest one-day gain in three years.\n\nThe rally in Japan was prompted by weaker than expected growth figures, which led to speculation that the Bank of Japan would also step in to shore up the economy.\n\nThe rally had already helped set a positive tone for European markets, which rose further after Draghi spoke. The FTSE 100 closed 2% higher at 5,824.28 with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2.7% to 9,206.84, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rising 3% to close at 4,115.25.\n\nIn the UK, Ian McCafferty, who sits on the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting body, the monetary policy committee, was also indicating that Threadneedle Street could act.\n\nDespite the environment of low interest rates, which might hamper policymakers\u2019 ability to inject stimulus, McCafferty said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t believe we are out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThere was scope to cut interest rates and revive its bond-buying programme if the economy lurches downward, or even impose negative interest rates. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, McCafferty, who had been voting for a rate rise until this month, said: \u201cI think an immediate rate rise isn\u2019t as necessary as I had felt last autumn.\u201d\n\nNext month is the seventh anniversary of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to lower official interest rates to 0.5%. Until recently, Threadneedle Street has been wary of pushing borrowing costs any lower for fear of the impact it might have on building societies, a concern that has now receded.\n\nAmid fears for the health of the banking sector, particularly in Italy, Draghi tried to allay concerns. \u201cIn the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012,\u201d he said.\n\nDraghi made his comments as some financial institutions responded to the poor start for 2016 by revising down their growth forecasts. At Axa, the forecasts for global GDP for 2016 were cut to 2.7%, down from 3.1%, while analysts at Berenberg said the slower start to the year had forced it to reduce its 2016 forecast for the US to 2.1%, from 2.3%. The Berenberg economists cut their predictions for eurozone GDP from 1.6% to 1.3%, citing market turmoil that was hitting sentiment.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}, [{"author": "Japan\u2019s growth figures were bad. The data for Chinese exports was even worse. A signal for the financial markets to have another dose of the heebie-jeebies? Not a bit of it. This was one of those days when bad news was good news.\n\nThe thinking goes as follows. If the Japanese economy shrank by 0.4% in the final three months of 2015 and Chinese exports fell by more than 11%, policymakers will sit up and take notice. Central banks will stimulate activity by cutting interest rates, even when they are already negative, and by expanding their quantitative easing (QE) programmes.\n\nRight on cue, Mario Draghi popped up before the European parliament to administer a bit of his own soothing balm. Yes, of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) is abreast of what has been going on in the markets, and \u201cwill not hesitate to act\u201d if necessary.\n\nMarkets took this as a promise from the ECB president that he will come up with more stimulus next month. More stimulus equals more growth equals higher corporate profits equals higher share prices.\n\nA moment\u2019s thought suggests this is a far from watertight thesis. For a start, financial markets should wait and see what Draghi does rather than get too excited about what he says. The ECB disappointed in December by not delivering as much extra stimulus as expected, in large part because Draghi ran into resistance from Germany.\n\nEven if the ECB does come up with the goods and this is accompanied by more action from the Bank of Japan and the People\u2019s Bank of China, there is no guarantee that it will have any material effect. There has been no shortage of action from central banks these past seven years and, let\u2019s be honest, the outcome has been disappointing.\n\nAndrew Lapthorne, analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, notes that one of the ploys being used by central banks \u2013 negative interest rates\u2013 is subject to the law of unintended consequences. Negative interest rates make holding government bonds attractive even when they are yielding next to nothing. Yet one of the rationales for QE is that it discourages investors from holding government bonds and encourages them to dabble in riskier assets.\n\nAll this prompts the conclusion that bad economic news really is bad news. In the current climate, there are really only two groups of people. Those who admit they don\u2019t really have a clue what\u2019s going on and those that don\u2019t have a clue but pretend that they do.

It\u2019s difficult because you want a player in but, if the player is not on the list, you\u2019d have to take someone.\n\n\u201cWe needed a player who could press at the top of the pitch; it wasn\u2019t just a goalscorer we were after because Luis Su\u00e1rez was giving us so much more than that. After a friendly against Milan I was asked the question and I felt Mario wasn\u2019t someone who suited the profile of what we were after.

When the owners are wanting you to go down that route and there\u2019s no other option, you give it a go.\u201d\n\nRodgers said he had identified S\u00e1nchez, then playing for Barcelona, as somebody better suited to the tactical system he wished to implement, and also claimed that Dele Alli was another target that Liverpool were unable to secure.\n\n\u201cThe huge blow was that we thought we were getting Alexis S\u00e1nchez and that he\u2019d be a like-for-like replacement [for Su\u00e1rez] in terms of how he pressed the game, his aggression,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d be perfect, it\u2019d be a smooth transition and Rickie Lambert would come in and be an option if we needed something else in the game.\n\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t get Alexis S\u00e1nchez and, bless Rickie, there was a lot of pressure on him when really that wasn\u2019t the plan. So we had to bring in someone, Mario has big talent \u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking I\u2019d be any different in terms of managers who\u2019ve had issues with him \u2013 and at that moment we didn\u2019t really have another option. It was something that didn\u2019t quite work for us and it cost us.\n\n\u201cI spoke to [Dele Alli] and Karl Robinson, the manager of MK Dons, drove him down to us,\u201d Rodgers continued. \u201cIt was all above board. Karl told me: \u2018I\u2019ve got a player I think\u2019s going to be fantastic and I\u2019d love to see him at Liverpool.\u2019 We watched him, he wanted to come but unfortunately it never got done between the clubs.

off a dangerous deflationary spiral, Mario Draghi has signalled.\n\nDraghi, the ECB\u2019s president, said on Thursday that the bank\u2019s governing council was unanimously willing to announce more unconventional measures, signalling the possibility of creating electronic money \u2013 or quantitative easing \u2013 should a deteriorating economy make it necessary.\n\nSpeaking in Frankfurt, he said: \u201cShould it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. \u201cThe governing council has tasked ECB staff and the relevant eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.\u201d\n\nEurozone inflation is 0.4%, far short of the central bank\u2019s target of close to 2%.\n\nDraghi added that the ECB balance sheet would continue to expand in the coming months and was likely to reach early 2012 levels, suggesting a further \u20ac1tn to be pumped into the economy. Despite announcing no new measures this month, Draghi\u2019s comments were enough to push the euro to a two-year low against the dollar and to cheer investors around Europe, with most of the major European markets, including the FTSE 100, closing up.\n\nAfter recent reports of a rift between the president and some of the council\u2019s minority over his leadership style, economists said this was a show of unity from Draghi and the ECB governing council.\n\n\u201cDraghi\u2019s press conference was a demonstration of unity and readiness to act at the ECB,\u201d said Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg. \u201cThe governing council now closed the ranks and emphasised their easing bias. [It] is clearly getting more enthusiastic about balance sheet expansion and quantitative easing.\u201d\n\nDraghi also played down the idea of a north-south divide emerging among eurozone countries: \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said when asked if there was a split.\n\nSeparately, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned in a stinging report that France, Germany and Italy must agree to jolt the eurozone economy back to life or face a long period of low growth, low inflation and an increasing debt burden.\n\nThe OECD, which counts the world\u2019s major trading states as members, said Spain and other smaller countries had shown the way by reforming their economies while the core nations were locked in discussions over how to lift growth.\n\nSpeaking before a G20 summit in Brisbane this month, the OECD\u2019s chief economist said governments needed to support efforts by the ECB to lower borrowing costs and boost public spending on education and infrastructure investment.\n\nCatherine Mann said: \u201cFiscal spending in the near term to support innovation, education, and infrastructure will both support near-term growth as well as turn back the legacy of low potential output and complement the engines of trade and investment.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Angela Monaghan",

on their decision to release John Terry back into the wild and instead offer him a new contract that would keep him in captivity at Stamford Bridge for at least another year. At least that\u2019s the conclusion some have leapt to following reports the club have cancelled plans to give him a big farewell dinner, a montage of his best bits, an endless stream of \u201cbanter\u201d at his expense and a live band.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nShould Terry stay at Chelsea, he could be joined by the Bayern Munich midfielder Mario G\u00f6tze, who has been told he has no future with the German champions. This news will come as something of a source of irritation to Liverpool, who had their hearts set on a cherubic 23-year-old who could change hands for as much as \u00a335m.\n\nThe phrase \u201csensational double swoop\u201d is not one the Daily Star bandies about lightly, but they\u2019ve reached for the heavy rumour-related artillery in a bid to do Manchester United\u2019s imminent efforts to bring Real Madrid\u2019s central defender Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Sporting\u2019s midfielder Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio anything resembling justice. The pair would cost something in the region of \u00a375m. Manchester United are also interested in taking Toni Kroos off Real\u2019s hands, but will face competition from Manchester City in their efforts to lure the German to the Premier League.\n\nIn other Manchester City-related tittle-tattle, the Mirror reports that this season\u2019s breakthrough striker Kelechi Iheanacho is after a new deal that would result in him trousering \u00a3150,000 per week, compared to the comparatively paltry \u00a315,000 on which he\u2019s being forced to scrape by at the moment.\n\nInformed speculation that Arsenal are to offer Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a two-year contract extension is likely to prompt fury among certain sections of the Emirates support, who will show their opposition to the idea by tutting audibly, shaking their heads and coyly holding up sheets of A4 on which they\u2019ve written \u201cCareful now\u201d.\n\nPresuming Wenger inks the deal, he\u2019ll retain the services of Mesut \u00d6zil, who is sitting behind a desk with pen poised while looking even more surprised than usual as he surveys the contract that will make him the club\u2019s first ever \u00a3200,000-per-week player.\n\nElsewhere in north London, that acrid stench over White Hart Lane is the smell of \u00a360m burning a hole in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s pocket. Having inked a new deal with the club, the Argentinian manager has been given a sizeable war chest with which to bolster his squad before next year\u2019s tilt at the Champions League. Half the amount could go on Marseille\u2019s striker Michy Batshuayi, although West Ham are also reported to be interested in the 22-year-old Belgian.\n\nAnd finally, Francesco Guidolin wants to make Leroy Fer\u2019s loan move from Queens Park Rangers to Swansea City permanent, having taken a shine to the Dutchman since arriving at the Liberty Stadium. \u201cLeroy has been a good surprise,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him before but he has helped the team in the last part of the season, he is a good player and it is possible he stays here.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.2, "magnitude": 0.2}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Barry Glendenning", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-05-09": [{"author": "Ratchet & Clank\n\nPS4, Sony, cert 7\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAt a very base level, the 11th Ratchet & Clank game is a fairly conventional 3D platformer, which sees its titular duo jump, smash and shoot their way to saving the galaxy. But this latest in the long-running series from the developer Insomniac \u2013 based on the forthcoming film, which is itself based on the very first Ratchet & Clank from 2002 \u2013 offers a great deal more than the sum of its parts.\n\nIt is, firstly, a quite beautiful game with abundant tongue-in-cheek charisma. Delivered as a playfully misremembered retelling of the first release, its pacing, personality, level design, audio and energy are superbly implemented. And while it is both linear and familiar, there\u2019s plenty of motivation to replay and explore each nook and cranny.\n\nRatchet & Clank\u2019s return does not reinvent the 3D platformer but why should it? The level of polish and craft throughout is striking, clearly demonstrating Insomniac\u2019s experience of \u2013 and love for \u2013 a genre that they have absolutely mastered.

Donkey Kong Country was a revolution when it first launched in 1994. Renowned at the time for its smile-inducing soundtrack, compelling platform gameplay and visuals that were unmatched thanks to new technology that allowed characters to be rendered in 3D. Twenty-two years later, the title remains as innovative as gamers will remember. The variety in gameplay is a joy, with Donkey and Diddy swinging on ropes, bouncing on tyres, flinging barrels, riding rhinos (and, of course, swordfish, ostriches and frogs) and careering at high speeds on runaway mine carts. It\u2019s also a blast in co-op.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not perfect, the platforming isn\u2019t as tight as Mario, it\u2019s a short game and there are a number of difficulty spikes. Yet these are minor flaws. Donkey Kong Country is as essential today as it was back in 1994.

It marks the fifth entry in the bizarre video game mascot to real-world sporting event crossover.\n\nThe title bundles 14 of the expected Olympic sports from the 100-metre sprint, to cycling and swimming. Controls for these events are often questionable, and even the games that do \u201cwork\u201d are simplistic and lacking in the depth to reward repeat play.\n\nThese are bound together by an RPG-lite hub world that has you collecting clothes and grinding experience points to level up the stats.

This, then, is the game that brought us raccoon tails, Koopa kids, sprawling world maps and the often-forgotten (until Super Mario Maker) Kuribo\u2019s shoe.\n\nThis Virtual Console iteration is the Game Boy Advance remake, complete with voiced Mario and Luigi. Of greater interest to completists is the exclusive European debut of the 38 extremely rare e-Card reader (an obscure import-only GBA card) courses. These range from remakes of classic Mario courses to some demanding concept stages, shuffling power-ups from various Mario titles together.

He can wear clothes that are only \u201cin keeping with the style of a club like Milan\u201d.

But, perhaps, this time he\u2019ll toe the line. If so, now is a good time to look back at some of his greatest salon hits.\n\nWhen he first burst on to the scene as a preternaturally gifted teenager in 2007 with Inter Milan, Balotelli played it straight up with a simple crop.

This was followed by a jet black pomp with swirling sides. For Balotelli, the top of the head is usually the place for the hair, while the sides are the place for a diffuse array of patterns that variously resemble arrowheads, train tracks and branded logos.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Balotelli\u2019s Sisq\u00f3-inspired \u2018hair disaster\u2019 in January 2013.

Balotelli was thought, at this time, to be playing some of the best football of his career and perhaps it was this praise for his maturity that led him to strike out and go full Sisq\u00f3 with this all-blond number, faithfully captured by the social media team at Manchester City, his club at the time. It was, reported HuffPo, a \u201chair disaster\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Balotelli goes back to basics in late 2013.

His dedication to dull never lasts and so in the summer of 2014, with his move from Milan to Liverpool about to be announced, Mario returned to his old favourite: the blond Mohawk \u2013 this time complete with plugs, for an updated look.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Balotelli\u2019s blond mohawk, autumn 2014.

Struggling on the pitch and seemingly unwanted by his manager, Brendan Rodgers, Mario returned again and again to a place of greater safety: the barber\u2019s chair. There was a moustache-Mohawk combo that made him look like a radical 1930s airman, a dark spike tower and the look branded \u201ccrazy\u201d by the Daily Mirror, a blond\u2019n\u2019swirly mohawk look that featured an intricately drawn dark Liver bird on the sides.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Balotelli spiked tower, February 2015.

was \u201cwilling and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, if warranted\u201d. Here are some of the options it might take to fulfil that promise on Thursday:\n\nExtending quantitative easing for longer\n\nThe ECB\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3780bn) quantitative easing (QE) scheme was announced in January and involved using electronically created money to buy bonds. The ECB hoped financial institutions would invest the proceeds elsewhere in the eurozone economy and that the programme would drive down the value of the euro, making exports more competitive. The current phase of QE is due to finish in September, but Draghi has always said it would continue, \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d. With inflation at just 0.1% in November, he could shift that deadline into 2017.\n\nIncreasing the scale of monthly bond purchases\n\nDraghi and his colleagues could increase the value of the government bonds they buy each month, from the current \u20ac60bn a month level. However, some analysts argue there are risks that the supply of bonds is not big enough to accommodate a big expansion. Draghi could also widen the scope of the bond purchases to include riskier asset classes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Draghi has vowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to secure the single currency. Photograph: DPA/Corbis\n\nCutting the deposit rate\n\nThe ECB already pays a negative deposit rate, of -0.2%, on reserves held at the central bank. In other words, banks must in effect pay the ECB for looking after their money: a measure aimed at keeping money flowing around the economy. The ECB could cut this rate further, which some analysts think could be as low as -0.4%.\n\nThere are also suggestions that it could introduce a two-tier deposit rate, similar to that adopted by the Danish and Swiss central banks, to penalise banks more heavily, the more of their reserves they keep out of circulation at the ECB.\n\nForward guidance\n\nDraghi is renowned for using carefully honed statements to direct the markets, most memorably when he promised at the height of the eurozone crisis in July 2012 that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to safeguard the single currency. He could use a similar dose of verbal reassurance on Thursday to convince investors the ECB will not let the economy slide into deflation.\n\nNothing at all\n\nFew analysts are betting on it, but it\u2019s not impossible that the ECB could decide to sit on its hands. Draghi may be a man of action, but he has previously faced strong resistance within the governing council, in particular from the German Bundesbank governor, Jens Weidmann.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Heather Stewart", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], [{"author": "A critical few weeks for the global economy will begin on Thursday when the European Central Bank (ECB) decides whether to take fresh steps to boost growth and stimulate inflation in the 19-country eurozone.\n\nFinancial markets are convinced the ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, will announce cuts in interest rates and a stepping up of the bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing (QE) after its latest policy meeting in Frankfurt.\n\nThe likely move comes as Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, dropped broad hints that the US central bank would raise US borrowing costs later this month for the first time since the global financial and economic crisis began more than eight years ago.\n\nSome analysts believe the sharply different strategies being pursued by the ECB and the Fed threaten a period of global financial turbulence.\n\nDavid Marsh and Ben Robinson of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum thinktank said: \u201cThe great monetary polarisation between the US and Europe is under way. After a period of close alignment since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, US and European monetary policies are about to diverge in dramatic fashion.\n\nEurozone inflation data raises prospect of fresh ECB stimulus Read more\n\n\u201cThe message from 70 years of monetary history is that, in the next few months, there is a roughly 50% chance of large-scale foreign exchange upheaval,\u201d they said.\n\nThe eurozone economy has been growing modestly in 2015 and unemployment has been coming down slowly, but the ECB is concerned about the low level of inflation. Latest data showed consumer prices rising by just 0.1% in the year to November, unchanged on October.\n\nAnalysts say that Draghi has three options open to him: to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, to expand the QE programme from its current \u20ac60bn (\u00a342bn) a month, and to extend the programme beyond next September, when it is due to end.\n\nJack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cAhead of the ECB\u2019s policy announcement, the question is how, rather than if, the governing council will loosen monetary policy. We expect an increase in the monthly pace of asset purchases from \u20ac60bn to \u20ac80bn, as well as a strong signal that the programme will last beyond next September.\u201d\n\nAllen said he expected the ECB to cut its deposit rate from -0.2% to -0.4%. Draghi is likely to face opposition on the ECB governing council, particularly from Germany, which does not believe more QE is appropriate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the ECB\u2019s announcement, attention will be focused on the foreign exchange markets, because QE tends to stimulate the economy by driving down the exchange rate and so boosting exports.\n\nHowever, this would come at a time when the prospect of a rise in US interest rates has strengthened the dollar.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}]], "2015-04-16": [{"author": "\n\nThe German activist who charged at ECB President Mario Draghi at a press conference, tossing confetti over him and shouting \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d, has said she was shocked at how easy it had been to carry out her stunt.\n\n\u201dI was stunned and surprised at how well it worked out and that I managed to get inside the building at all. It felt very high risk and all the time I was thinking this could easily not work,\u201d Josephine Witt told the Guardian, a day after her protest at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt.\n\nThe 21-year old philosophy student revealed she had registered as a journalist under the name of Vice Media, the news website which has a German edition, for whom Witt does not work.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josephine Witt makes her point felt.\n\n\u201cI went through the normal registration process, and once there, through the airport-style controls and showed my ID. They check your bags, but I only had paper in mine which I thought was not unusual for a journalist,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201dAs we were waiting for the press conference to start I heard some journalists saying, \u2018These ECB press conferences are usually quite boring,\u2019 and I thought to myself: \u2018Maybe this time it\u2019ll be a bit different.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoon after Draghi began his statement on monetary policy, Witt, dressed in a black T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d climbed on top of the desk where Draghi was speaking, and threw a pile of leaflets at him. She then showered him in white confetti, while all the time repeatedly chanting \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d.\n\nWitt, who lives in Hamburg, was quickly dragged off by security guards and arrested but later released. It is unclear whether the ECB will press charges against her.\n\nShe said that after last month\u2019s protests outside the ECB\u2019s new headquarters, in which anti-austerity demonstrators clashed with police, she had wanted to stage her own peaceful demonstration inside the bank.\n\n\u201dAfter the aggressive police tactics used outside the ECB, I wanted to show a positive way of non-radical, peaceful protest inside the devil\u2019s den,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat could have been better than dancing on the table of that unelected man in his ivory tower?\n\n\u201cThe picture of Mario Draghi\u2019s face was priceless \u2013 he was scared, surprised and shaken, and gone was the big poker-faced banker \u2013 it was suddenly just an ordinary man there in front of me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted to demonstrate is that economics are not just some god-given thing that we have to accept and go along with. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d\n\nWitt said she was convinced that Europe needed a \u201cnew narrative\u201d. \u201cWe have this image that the northern countries are disciplined and hard-working and the southern countries are just lying on the beach doing nothing. This is a racist narrative that\u2019s dividing our united Europe. The ECB and the troika is only feeding into this, but we can\u2019t let it divide our continent.\u201d\n\nShe said she was also angry at the economic imbalances that have emerged since the financial crisis began, balances which had also affected Germany. \u201cJust as it\u2019s untrue to say the Greeks are lying on their backs, neither is it true that all Germans are rich,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gap between the rich and the poor is bigger here than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d\n\nWitt is part of the European feminist Femen protest movement and has previously participated in high-profile attacks against Vladimir Putin at a trade fair in Hanover, a topless protest in Tunisia for which she spent four weeks in jail, and a Christmas Day protest in Cologne Cathedral for which she is still going through a court process. But in Frankfurt she insists, she was acting alone.\n\n\u201cIt was refreshing to know that under the right circumstances I could get just as good a response by not staging a topless action,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the response alone I got from people all round the world, I think it was a big success.\n\n\u201cI got tonnes of emails, some blogposts about me, from Canada to Australia people were congratulating me and thankful for what I did, and that made it worth it. There were only some macho responses commenting on my underwear, but they were in the minority.\u201d\n\nJosephine Witt (@josephine_witt) so i jump on draghi's desk, and people discuss my undies... #FEMINISM #MORE_FEMINISM ;) pic.twitter.com/kZcNGE9bnf\n\nWitt\u2019s parents, a physiotherapist mother and a father who has a solar panel business, have become used to the drama of their daughter\u2019s activist lifestyle, she said.\n\n\u201cMy parents saw it on the news. They won\u2019t be very proud of their daughter, but they sent me a text message to check I was OK,\u201d she said.\n\nWitt said she had a \u201clist in my head\u201d of other figureheads she plans to attack. She added that the standout difference between the Putin and Draghi attacks was that while Putin\u2019s lack of facial expression \u201cshowed just how much plastic surgery he\u2019s had, from what I saw close up, Draghi clearly hasn\u2019t had much done.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Kate Connolly", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null,

deflation when he said policy makers at the bank were \"comfortable\" about action in early June.\n\nUpward pressure on the euro eased and yields on government bonds fell after the ECB president expressed concern that weak growth and the possible knock-on effects from the Ukraine could derail the eurozone's fragile recovery.\n\nAlthough Draghi announced no change in policy following the meeting of the ECB's general council in Brussels, he signalled that a move could come once his in-house economists produce updated forecasts for inflation in the first few days of next month.\n\n\"I would say that the governing council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June,\" Draghi told a press conference.\n\n\"There is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this,\" he said. \"We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in early June.\"\n\nInflation across the 18-nation eurozone currently stands at 0.7% but the financial markets expect it to fall closer to zero when the flash estimates of the May cost of living are published on June 3.\n\nThe ECB council meets two days later and while some analysts said Draghi had left himself some room for manoeuvre, most believe action from the ECB to counter deflationary pressures is all but inevitable.\n\n\"The recovery is proceeding but it is proceeding at a slow pace, and it still remains fairly modest, and there are some downward risks now,\" Draghi said. \"The risks have to do with the possible weakening of global demand, have to do with geopolitical risks that are of serious significance, and have to do with \u2026 the exchange rate.\"\n\nOn the foreign exchanges, the euro moved close to $1.40 when the ECB said it was taking no immediate action. But it later dropped by more than a cent after Draghi's remarks at his press conference. The prospect of cuts in interest rates, possibly backed by the start of a eurozone quantitative easing programme also bore down on bond yields. In Germany, the interest rate on the 10-year bund dropped to 1.45%, close to last week's 11-year low.\n\nCity economists expressed doubts about whether ECB action would be enough to see off the threat from deflation. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, said the ECB seemed likely to offer a token rate cut in June, but remained some distance from more aggressive easing. \"The ECB is hoping continued economic recovery will ease deflation fears, meaning QE isn't required. But the threat of deflation remains significant, even for some 'core' countries. With the ECB reluctant to properly insure against this prospect, a negative growth surprise is needed before we could see euro-area QE.\"\n\nJennifer McKeown, senior European economist, at Capital Economics, said: \"The ECB signalled very strongly at today's press conference that policy will be loosened next month. A small cut in the main refinancing rate seems like the least that the Bank could do and is unlikely to be particularly effective. Bolder policy action, perhaps including asset purchases, should not be far off.\"", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Larry Elliott", "entities": {"Ed

unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures against the backdrop of a fragile global economy.\n\nAmid growing concerns of a fresh economic crash, the eurozone\u2019s central bank surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates in the region to an all-time low, expanding its money printing programme and reducing a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory.\n\nThe ECB chief, Mario Draghi, implied interest rates would stay \u201cvery low\u201d for at least another year and predicted the region would remain mired in negative inflation for months to come. But he played down speculation that interest rates could be cut even further.\n\n\n\nECB stimulus hint steadies markets Read more\n\n\u201cFrom today\u2019s perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don\u2019t anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. Of course, new facts can change the situation and the outlook,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based institution hopes its latest barrage of measures will get money into the financial system by discouraging banks from holding on to deposits. The expectation is that financial institutions will instead lend out money as cheaply as possible to businesses and households.\n\nIn the UK, ministers campaigning for the country to stay in the EU will be hoping the latest package of ECB support will ward off a fresh crisis in the eurozone, because financial turmoil could undermine their case ahead of June\u2019s referendum.\n\nThe measures went well beyond what investors had been expecting and led to wild swings on already febrile financial markets. The euro initially plunged as record low interest rates were announced, before bouncing back as Draghi implied this was the lowest the central bank would go on borrowing costs.\n\nGoing further than economists had expected, the ECB reduced the eurozone\u2019s main interest rate from 0.05% to zero, also cut its two other interest rates, expanded its quantitative easing (QE) programme and announced new ultra-cheap, four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates.\n\n\n\nOn stock markets, share prices were boosted when the rate cuts were announced but gains were cut as Draghi suggested there was no additional help to come.\n\nHow the ECB is trying to revive the eurozone Read more\n\n\u201cThe ECB attempted to exceed market expectations with a strong set of non-conventional monetary policy measures but then disappointed the market on forward guidance around further interest rate reductions \u2013 effectively suggesting that interest rates had reached their nadir,\u201d said Marilyn Watson at fund manager BlackRock.\n\n\n\nAs expected by markets, the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points, further into negative territory to -0.4%. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight, with the aim of encouraging them to lend it to businesses. The marginal lending rate, paid by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight, was cut from 0.3% to to 0.25%.\n\n\n\nThe ECB expanded its QE programme to \u20ac80bn (\u00a361bn) a month, up from \u20ac60bn. Under QE, the central bank pumps money into the eurozone by buying bonds off financial institutions in the expectation that they will reinvest the proceeds elsewhere in the European economy. The QE programme will now include buying bonds issued by companies and not just by financial institutions.\n\nDraghi and his fellow policymakers had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone\u2019s economy after the single-currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February.\n\n\n\nThe ECB chief used a news conference to insist the region was not in full-on, Japan-style deflation and to rebuff growing fears that central banks have run out of ammunition to fight sluggish economic growth and revive price rises. Negative inflation is viewed as economically dangerous because falling prices can create a downward spiral of economic growth, by dissuading businesses and consumers from spending in the expectation that prices will fall further.\n\n\n\nWithout Thursday\u2019s measures, the eurozone would have faced \u201cdisastrous deflation\u201d, Draghi added.\n\nThe ECB is predicting inflation in the eurozone will be just 0.1% this year, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 \u2013 all under its target for inflation, close to but below 2%.\n\nEconomists are becoming increasingly sceptical of the power of monetary policy as central banks around the world resort to increasingly unconventional measures to shore up their economies.\n\nECB can only buy time, not solve eurozone growth woes Read more\n\n\u201cHaving mislaid his bazooka in December, Mario Draghi has returned to the fray firing a blunderbuss,\u201d said Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson Global Investors. \u201cWhile superficially impressive, this scattershot approach will probably have limited impact on monetary conditions and the economic outlook.\u201d\n\nFor their part, central bankers have become increasingly frustrated with the failure of governments to push through economic reforms, eight years on from the global financial crisis. Draghi echoed recent comments by his UK counterpart, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that ministers cannot leave central banks to do all the work on driving the economic recovery.\n\nDraghi said: \u201cIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ECB chief cited a host of risks to economic growth from stumbling emerging economies, volatile financial markets and the slow pace of structural reforms.\n\n\n\nDraghi\u2019s comments reflected evidence that \u201cthe effectiveness of monetary policy is clearly diminishing\u201d, said Alasdair Cavalla at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\n\n\n\u201cDraghi threw down the gauntlet to fiscal policymakers today, arguing for infrastructure spending while lowering the ECB\u2019s own growth forecasts,\u201d said Cavalla.\n\nKipper Williams on ECB cutting eurozone interest rate to zero Read more\n\nSome analysts welcomed the announcement of ultra-cheap loans to banks, hoping they could mitigate the impact of ultra-low interest rates, which create difficulties for commercial banks by making it harder for them to lend profitably.\n\n\u201cThe icing on the cake was the announcement of a new, longer-term bank lending programme,\u201d said Barbara Teixeira Araujo, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nNegative rates on these new loans to banks would \u201cpartially compensate the extra costs related to the further cut in deposit rates, easing worries about negative interest rates cutting into banks\u2019 profitability and potentially hurting the banking system\u201d, she added.\n\n\n\nBut analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics were less sanguine about the overall ECB package: \u201cThere is no guarantee that its latest \u2018bazooka\u2019 will be any more effective than previous ones in securing the strong and sustained growth required to eliminate the threat of deflation in the currency union and allow the peripheral countries to tackle their debt problems. The ECB has belatedly delivered, but it can\u2019t work miracles.\u201d", "sentiment": {"score": 0.4, "magnitude": 0.4}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Katie Allen", "entities": {"Ed Aarons":

Now it has the opposite concern.\n\nThe fear of deflation explains the package of measures announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures.\n\nThe ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u20ac60bn (\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u20ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies.\n\nAnd still it wasn\u2019t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates.\n\nMarkets volatile after ECB cuts interest rates and boosts QE - business live Read more\n\nThere is certainly a need for bolstering demand in the eurozone. Since December, the ECB has revised down its 2016 growth projection for thesingle currency bloc from 1.7% to 1.4%, but the really big change has been to its forecast for inflation. Three months ago, it was expecting the eurozone cost of living to go up by 1% this year: it is now pencilling in an increase of 0.1%.\n\nDraghi\u2019s plan is to make money plentiful and to make it cheap, yet the eurozone\u2019s problem is not a lack of credit supply, which is at a five-year high, but the weakness of demand for loans even at historically low interest rates. There are limits to what central banks can do and the ECB is rapidly approaching them.\n\nDraghi knows that monetary policy \u2013 interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow \u2013 can only do so much. He would like his actions to be supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy. Catherine Mann, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, thinks the same.

He then added: \u201cBut many games have been thrilling, and I was happy for the boys. It wasn\u2019t too hard [for me] during the tournament because I\u2019d had time to digest not being part of the team.\u201d\n\nNobody had missed the tall centre-forward in Brazil. He had been injured for most of the 2013-14 season and performed poorly for Fiorentina in Serie A. Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s Nationalmannschaft had moved on from playing with a recognised striker to a more fluid system with \u201cfalse 9s\u201d in the qualification campaign. Worse still, they had moved on from him, the truest No9 of his generation, after three tournaments of near misses, two of which were later blamed on Gomez not taking his chances in crucial games. \u201cI was the scapegoat, I felt hard done by,\u201d the 30-year-old told Tagesspiegel.\n\nItaly\u2019s tournament hold over Germany set for latest test at Euro 2016 | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nThe former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness, too, had singled out the attacker in the wake of the club\u2019s traumatic defeat by Chelsea in the Champions League final at the Allianz Arena in 2012. \u201cMario Gomez is a good striker,\u201d Hoeness said. \u201cIf he was a very good striker, we would have won the game.\u201d His place up front was taken by Croatia\u2019s Mario Mandzukic as Bayern powered to a treble in the 2012-13 season and the club unceremoniously offloaded him to Italy amid rumours of dressing-room tensions before the arrival of Pep Guardiola.\n\nAn urge to prove everyone wrong took the sensitive striker down a cul de sac of too much pressure, of trying too hard. His time as an elite striker seemed over altogether last summer, when he agreed, after much deliberation about the unstable political situation in Turkey, to move to Besiktas in the Turkish Super Lig, where plenty of former greats get paid huge salaries in exchange for toiling at the periphery of European football, off the radar. Last exit Istanbul: refuge of stars with broken dreams and derailed careers.\n\nGomez, however, made a promise to himself: it would be a new beginning, not the end. He was going to recalibrate, ignore the negativity, fall back in love with the game, score goals again, play for Germany again. \u201cIn July, I decided that my aim was to make it to the Euros and to win it with this team. Even if I only played three minutes or not at all.\u201d\n\nAs early as September, he felt that the joy returned along with the fitness, and with it the born poacher\u2019s sixth sense of where the ball was going to fall at his feet in the opposition box. Gomez netted 26 times to fire Besiktas to the championship and finish the campaign as Turkey\u2019s leading goalscorer. After a 14-month absence, L\u00f6w recalled him for the ill-fated friendly against France in November, the night of the terror attacks in Paris.\n\nGomez did well in the 3-2 defeat by England in March but his chances to make the squad were then still rated low enough for Panini not to include him in their Euro 2016 sticker book. Even as the Bundestrainer confirmed his place in the squad in May, the expectation in Germany was that Gomez was only being taken to France as a two-legged emergency measure, to be called upon in the unlikely event that Germany fell behind and had to divert from L\u00f6w\u2019s aesthetically pleasing short-pass game to a more agricultural approach with a big man up top.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone, however, Gomez\u2019s new-found, zen-like demeanour and \u201cTibetan calmness\u201d (Frankfurter Rundschau) off the pitch has translated into strong showings, two goals, and seen him emerge as the unlikeliest of key players for Germany at these Euros. He\u2019s a player \u201cresurrected,\u201d wrote Stuttgarter Zeitung about the former local hero, born to a Swabian mother and a Spanish immigrant father from the Andalusian mining village of Albu\u00f1\u00e1n.\n\nGomez no longer looks as if he\u2019s a hindrance to Germany\u2019s fluidity, he has in fact enabled it in France, with intelligent movement. \u201cYou can play football with him,\u201d Lothar Matth\u00e4us said, while his physical presence has been such that plenty of German reporters have penned odes to his \u201cwell-toned model athlete upper body\u201d (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with my game like never before,\u201d he told the media, in four different languages, in the Lille mixed zone after the 3-0 win over Slovakia with a huge smile on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t measure my performances in goals any more, it\u2019s more important that my team-mates see how hard I work for them.\u201d\n\nA win against Italy \u2013 Germany\u2019s bogey team and the side who beat Gomez and his men 2-1 in the Euro 2012 semi-final in Warsaw, his last competitive international before this summer\u2019s comeback \u2013 would bring him closer to fulfilling his own promise, and open the door to the happiest return of all.

At the end of the review, the novelist Joshua Cohen suggested there might be something hypocritical about Vargas Llosa\u2019s condemnation of the infiltration of popular culture\u2019s values into high culture and in particular his trashing of trashy journalism. The 79-year-old, he pointed out, had recently appeared in Hola! (the Spanish parent magazine of Hello!) in an \u201cexclusive story\u201d revealing his new relationship with the socialite Isabel Preysler, ex-wife and mother respectively of the pop stars Julio and Enrique Iglesias, and told the celebrity weekly the affair was \u201cgoing very well\u201d.\n\nEnraged, the 2010 Nobel literature laureate thundered that he was \u201cflabbergasted to learn that this kind of gossip can find its way into a respectable publication such as the Book Review\u201d - a \u201cslanderous and perfidious\u201d instance of the convergence of posh and pop that his book inveighs against. \u201cI have never had a Twitter account\u201d, he insisted, and \u201chave never sold a story to Hola!\u201d, so Cohen had been wrong to assert (on the basis of a Daily Mail article, which recycled allegations in the Spanish press) that he had tweeted about the affair and been paid for the photo-feature. Both claims were deleted from the review, which now appears online with a humiliating triple correction beneath it, as originally it also misspelt Preysler\u2019s name.\n\nThe next day, the French novelist Michel Houellebecq similarly took up the cudgels against a broadsheet newspaper usually seen as earnest and respectable, even stuffy. As a curtain-raiser to the madness of France\u2019s \u201crentr\u00e9e litt\u00e9raire\u201d (589 novels will be published between mid-August and mid-October) and the stately unfolding of its literary prize season (the Goncourt 2015 longlist, presumably featuring Houellebecq\u2019s Submission, will be announced on Thursday), Le Monde had run a series of biographical articles about the scruffy, grumpy novelist, homing in on his drinking and his choice of home (a tower block in a far from fashionable part of Paris), and telling an anecdote of him being treated as a tramp when he stayed at a monastery for research. Houellebecq reacted by calling reporters \u201ccockroaches\u201d and accusing the writer of the series of making \u201cmalicious slyness\u201d her \u201ctrademark\u201d; more seriously, he argued that revealing his \u201cdaily habits\u201d would cause his police bodyguards difficulties (he is a potential target because of his past criticisms of Islam and Submission, which imagines a future France under an Islamist government and appeared on the same day as the Charlie Hebdo murders). But, unlike the New York Times, Le Monde refused to back down; the editor, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fenoglio, instead counterattacked, effectively calling Houellebecq a control freak.\n\nHe was able to be so defiant because there was much that was puzzling about Houellebecq\u2019s complaint. Fenoglio and the writer, Ariane Chemin, responded that every detail of the author\u2019s everyday life in the pieces had already appeared elsewhere with his consent (and to amusedly point out that they hadn\u2019t disclosed, pace Houellebecq, that he did his shopping at his local Monoprix). But also the author has put his personal life into the public domain in his fiction as well as when promoting it. And his self-depiction in the Goncourt-winning The Map and the Territory (in which the protagonist, an artist, creates a portrait of him) is far less lenient than Le Monde\u2019s portrayal: its \u201cMichel Houellebecq\u201d is a morose, alcoholic, latently suicidal, possibly paranoid near-recluse and misanthrope.\n\nVargas Llosa has been warier of making his private self public, but nevertheless his protest had puzzling aspects, too. The Hola! article has not been taken down, and visitors to hola.com will find he and Preysler graced the 1 July issue\u2019s cover and reappeared on holiday this week, with the literary grandee showing no sign of displeasure at being photographed and joining the media spectacle his book disdains.\n\nRather than being a cheap jibe, Cohen\u2019s ironic noting of his celebrity status continued the argument of a review that suggested he exemplifies the very mixing up of lowbrow and highbrow he criticises: as a regular newspaper columnist, a novelist whose film- and soap opera-influenced books are a \u201chigh-low blend\u201d, and now a B-lister fated to be \u201cpaparazzied\u201d. The older novelist\u2019s letter overlooked this well-informed and cogent critique, instead focusing (just like any other aggrieved celeb) on the misinformation about tweets and photo deals. In ignoring the more serious issue, you could argue that he was being revealingly shallow.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "John Dugdale", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2015-11-11": [{"author": "The latest attempt by the government to rehabilitate the battered reputation of the City of London takes place on Wednesday when Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, invites the public to have their say on the future of financial markets.\n\nCarney has invited the chancellor, George Osborne, and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, to be the guests of honour at a day-long event at the Guildhall in London.\n\nHalf the 400-strong audience will be made up of members of the public who were allocated their seats by ballot and will have the chance to sit alongside representatives of the banks blamed for crashing the economy and besmirching the reputation of the financial sector.\n\nInside the Bank of England | Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott Read more\n\nCarney announced the Open Forum following the Libor and foreign exchange scandals.

has prompted protests from politicians and pundits, angered by what they say has been the Peruvian writer\u2019s \u201cdisrespect\u201d of the Caribbean country.\n\nA group of Dominican and foreign academics chose Vargas Llosa, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010, as the recipient of the Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a literary prize in April.\n\nDominicans of Haitian descent turned into \u2018ghost citizens', says Amnesty Read more\n\nBut Gustavo Montalvo, the Dominican minister of the presidency, said in a statement that the prize would be inappropriate because of the author\u2019s comments about a controversial Dominican court ruling on immigration in 2013 that stripped thousands of people born in the Dominican Republic \u2013 mostly of Haitian origin \u2013 of their citizenship.\n\nMontalvo said that while he did not question Vargas Llosa\u2019s literary merits, it would be inappropriate to give him a prize because of his \u201caggressive and false comments about laws and their application in the country.\u201d\n\nIn a 2013 article published in the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Vargas Llosa called the ruling by the Dominican constitutional court that stripped many ethnic Haitians of their Dominican nationality a \u201clegal aberration\u201d inspired by Hitler-era legal sentences that denied Jews German citizenship.\n\nMontalvo called Vargas Llosa\u2019s attitude toward the Dominican Republic \u201cdisrespectful and offensive\u201d.\n\nAt the time that Vargas Llosa\u2019s article was published, many Dominicans staged protests in the country burning copies of the author\u2019s book Feast of the Goat, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961.\n\nThe publication of the novel in 2000 was not entirely well received in the Dominican Republic because many felt it painted the country in a dim light.\n\nIn a letter to the Dominican minister of culture Vargas Llosa said he was grateful for the prize. \u201cThe fact that, despite that incident, I am given this prize, speaks well of the democratic, tolerant and open spirit that luckily seems to prevail in the country.\u201d\n\nDominican author Junot D\u00edaz, whose novel The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao won the 2008 Pulitzer, was also heavily criticised for speaking out against the constitutional court\u2019s decision and what he called the persecution of immigrants \u2013 mainly Haitians \u2013 in the Dominican Republic.\n\nHe was called \u201canti-Dominican\u201d by the Dominican Republic\u2019s consul in New York, who also stripped D\u00edaz of the order of merit award given to him in 2009.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.1, "magnitude": 0.1}, "time": "00:00:00",

way of Liverpool\u2019s transfer plans by insisting the striker will not be leaving Anfield this summer, although the club remain determined to cut their losses on the Italy forward.\n\nThe 24-year-old endured a miserable season on Merseyside following his \u00a316m arrival from Milan last August, starting only 14 games in all competitions, scoring four goals and being publicly criticised several times by his manager, Brendan Rodgers. The forward was also hindered by injury and illness and did not feature in any of Liverpool\u2019s last four match-day squads.\n\nLiverpool are prepared to take a substantial financial hit to offload Balotelli this summer. The former Manchester City striker earns a basic \u00a380,000-a-week plus top-ups related to performance and behaviour, and has two years remaining on his three-year contract. The club have an option for a fourth year but it underlines his unsuitability to Rodgers\u2019 system that they are keen for him to go after one.\n\nSampdoria have an interest in taking Balotelli back to Serie A with Liverpool determined to overhaul a strike force that scored only eight league goals last season. But the striker\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, has claimed his client is not considering a move. \u201cI have had talks with Liverpool and he will definitely stay,\u201d Raiola told Sky Sports News.\n\nSteven Gerrard vows to return to Liverpool in the future Read more\n\nRodgers criticised Balotelli\u2019s work-rate and inability to adapt to the team\u2019s demands several times last season, but Raiola says the problem has not been down to his client. \u201cMario did [adapt]. I can\u2019t talk for Brendan, that is a question for him, but Mario did and I spoke various times to the club and they were happy with Mario as a professional. I am confident it will happen next year.\u201d\n\nOf Liverpool\u2019s recognised strike force from last season \u2013 Daniel Sturridge, Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Balotelli \u2013 only the injury-prone Sturridge features in the manager\u2019s plans for next term. Balotelli, Borini and Lambert are among a host of players the club is willing to sell this summer, a list that also includes Jos\u00e9 Enrique, Luis Alberto and Sebasti\u00e1n Coates. Iago Aspas will join Sevilla on a permanent basis following a season-long loan spell with the Andaluc\u00edan club, while Glen Johnson and Brad Jones will leave as free agents when their contracts expire next month.\n\nIn a sign that Rodgers retains the backing of Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owner, despite a dismal end to the season, the club are advancing with established plans for a new-look attack. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke is a leading transfer target and Liverpool are expected to bid for the Belgium international after the FA Cup final. Divock Origi has already been signed from Lille for \u00a39.8m and Anfield is understood to be Danny Ings\u2019 preferred destination despite Tottenham Hotspur and Real Sociedad also having interest in the Burnley striker.\n\nIngs is out of contract at Turf Moor this summer but the 22-year-old will command a development fee of around \u00a35m-\u00a36m, to be set by a tribunal if Burnley and the buying club cannot agree a price.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.3, "magnitude": 0.3}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Andy Hunter", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2016-01-01": [{"author": "It\u2019s Louis van Gaal time! 2016 is the Chinese Year of the Red Monkey, and if that doesn\u2019t sound auspicious enough already for Manchester United, then you should know that the club\u2019s manager was born in 1951, which was the Year of the Rabbit. As anyone who\u2019s hastily consulted the esteemed chinesefortunecalendar.com website can tell you, that means that Van Gaal is all set for a particularly happy year because \u201cwhen Rabbit meets Monkey, Rabbit will become a favourite and popular figure\u201d.\n\nChinese zodiac sages do counsel Van Gaal against further jousting with the media \u2013 \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have disputes with others during this period\u201d \u2013 and suggest \u201cpay attention on your arms, legs, liver and nervous system\u201d, but aside from those caveats 2016 will be a year of triumph for the Dutchman: \u201cYou\u2019re the favourite person in your group. You will win good reputation from everybody \u2026 Your people relationship is pretty good. Everything will come in your way. The result will be very satisfactory to you.\u201d\n\nSo the only question now is: does Mario G\u00f3mez want a piece of that action? The rumours are that Van Gaal wants the Besiktas striker who was born in the Year of the Ox (or Cow) to fix United\u2019s scoring problems and, indeed, the aforementioned site warns that \u201cWhen Cow meets Monkey, it\u2019s time for Cow to stand up on the performance stage\u201d. So will G\u00f3mez accept the challenge?\n\nOK, since this is not the Year of the Dead Horse, we\u2019ll stop flogging this riff now. But we\u2019ll carry on with the Manchester United chat for a bit, as Van Gaal is also said to be scouting Fulham\u2019s 19-year-old striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. But the French forward has other admirers, too, including Tottenham Hotspur, whose fans may have to ditch that \u201cThere\u2019s only one Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u201d chant.\n\nManchester City target move for Schalke and Germany forward Leroy San\u00e9 Read more\n\nLiverpool are also looking at Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (the young French striker rather than mercurial Belgian midfielder). In addition, J\u00fcrgen Klopp is eager to bolster his team\u2019s defence so he\u2019s checking out Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres, the Uruguayan centre-back who is out of favour at Juventus. Inter and Fenerbahce are also on the case. Meanwhile on the goalkeeper front, there are suggestions that the talk about Simon Mignolet being offered a new contract was just a gag aimed at alarming Liverpool fans, with the club now being linked to several others No1s, including Marseille\u2019s Steve Mandanda and even the Mexico international Guillermo Ochoa, who was outstanding at the last World Cup but has been mainly sitting out at M\u00e1laga since moving to Spain. If Liverpool go for Mandanda, Marseille will move for Ochoa.\n\nNorwich are also eyeing up Mandanda and the ambitious Canaries are also plotting a \u00a37.5m bid for Inter central defender Andrea Ranocchia. R\u00e9mi Garde has been attempting to persuade Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s back-up goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, to move to Aston Villa. Unfortunately for Garde, Sirigu has seen Villa play. PSG, meanwhile, are out scouring the world for the next superstar and believe they have found him in the form, and indeed the person, of Giovani Lo Celso, a 19-year-old currently with Argentinian club Rosario. Chelsea are also eager to sign the teenager: but Juventus are said to be closest to agreeing a deal.\n\nR\u00e9my Cabella will soon make his loan move from Newcastle to Marseille permanent. Roma want to offer Mathieu Debuchy a regular run-out, and Arsenal aren\u2019t expected to raise many objections.

Ten successive wins in qualifying for Euro 2016 have been followed by a clear defeat on the first occasion they play one of Europe\u2019s leading nations and by now, it all seems terribly predictable.\n\nIf there was one consolation, it was that England did avoid this game spiralling into the kind of ordeal that was threatened during the opening stages. Hodgson\u2019s players could hardly get a kick in those moments and after a difficult start they did at least play with a degree of composure during the middle part of the match. Ultimately, though, the moments of high quality came from Vicente del Bosque\u2019s side, most notably the wonderfully taken goal from their right-back, Mario P\u00e9rez, that set up the victory.\n\nThe defender\u2019s spinning volley was the outstanding moment of a night when Spain clocked up their seventh successive victory and England were beaten for the first time since the World Cup or, to put it another way, the last time they played a decent side.\n\nEngland\u2019s Tuesday friendly with France likely to be cancelled Read more\n\nSanti Cazorla added the second goal and, more than anything, it seemed like a reality check for the team with the best qualifying record for Euro 2016.

And they won while still leaving the distinct impression they were operating within themselves and that if the mood took them they may just really start to try.\n\nThe electronic scoreboard at one end of this roofless stadium, with the bats fluttering in the night sky, had almost ticked into its second minute before an England player had touched the ball from kickoff. The tone had been set and, having breezed through their Euro 2016 qualifying programme, this was a new challenge for Hodgson\u2019s men, chasing the ball and enduring long passages where the bottom line was that the other side were vastly superior on the ball. For England, there were times when their efforts to get it back were almost as futile as attempts by the Spanish fans to get the away end to join in with the Mexican wave.\n\nMore alarmingly, there was also a tendency when England did get the ball to give it straight back with remarkable alacrity. It is the lack of refinement in possession that can be startling and the tendency to rush passes. Spain, in stark contrast, make possession look easy.\n\nThey passed, they moved and they looked up to see where the next pass was. Spain no longer have a striker in the mould of David Villa or a peak Fernando Torres, but they wear down opponents with their rhythmical style.\n\nEngland, to give them their due, did also create a couple of half-chances during the closing stages of the first half. Chris Smalling and Phil Jones took good care of Diego Costa, who managed to go through the match without any confrontation, and the goals arrived at a point when Spain had started to look a little tepid in attack.\n\nAfter 72 minutes, Cesc F\u00e0bregas chipped a pass over Mario\u2019s shoulder and the right-back, coming inside Ryan Bertrand, turned elegantly to redirect the ball with a swivelling, diagonal volley into the far corner of the goal. It was a tremendous effort but Hodgson\u2019s irritation stemmed from the fact it came from Raheem Sterling losing the ball in an encouraging position.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn our lesson and remember that when we are playing a team of this quality we cannot afford to make technical mistakes,\u201d the manager said.\n\nHodgson immediately brought on Wayne Rooney and in the closing stages England\u2019s record scorer struck a volley into the turf that came up and hit the top of the crossbar. By then, however, Spain had scored again and the game was winding down. England\u2019s players must have been relieved Andr\u00e8s Iniesta played only the first half \u2013 Hodgson said afterwards a lot of his preparation had been around trying to subdue the Barcelona man \u2013 but his replacement, Nolito, also created problems on Spain\u2019s left. Nolito found Cazorla, who had replaced the injured Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara after 26 minutes, and the Arsenal midfielder curled home his shot.\n\nEngland\u2019s mitigation is their long list of absentees and they were dealt another blow late in the match when Michael Carrick was taken off on a stretcher having damaged ankle ligaments. Carrick is elegant enough to fit into Spain\u2019s midfield but his luckless run of injuries continues. In the unlikely event Tuesday\u2019s game against France goes ahead, he will be missing.\n\nOn a brighter note, Bertrand was always keen to break forward from his full-back position and Fabien Delph should be better for his first start since damaging a hamstring early in the game against Switzerland in September.\n\nFor the most part, however, there was not a great deal of opportunity for Ross Barkley and Harry Kane to build their understanding. Sterling was prominently involved but ran down too many cul-de-sacs and Hodgson did not try to dress it up afterwards. England, he said, had to make more use of the ball because when you give it away at this level it can be a long time before you get it back again.\n\nSpain v England: international friendly \u2013 as it happened!

threatened with deflation and the risks of an escalating conflict in Ukraine.\n\nPolicymakers cut the already ultra-low main interest rate from 0.15% to 0.05%. They also made it more expensive for banks to park money with the ECB \u2013 cutting the deposit rate, which was already negative, from -0.1% to -0.2% in the hope of persuading banks to lend more to businesses and consumers.\n\nThe action took investors by surprise and drove the euro down more than two cents against the dollar to a 14-month low of $1.29. A weaker currency helps the eurozone's exporters.\n\nIn London the Bank of England held rates at a record low of 0.5% for the 66th monthly meeting in a row.\n\nEuropean stock markets rose following the decisive action from the ECB president, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues on the governing council. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies across the region, rose 1.2% to its highest close since January 2008.\n\n\"The ECB stepped up to the plate as the eurozone recovery is grinding almost to a halt,\" said Christian Schulz, a senior economist at the German bank Berenberg.\n\nThe central bank announced further measures to encourage lending by buying asset-backed securities. Full details will be published in October, Draghi said.\n\nThe ECB stopped short of embarking on full-scale quantitative easing (QE) which would potentially involve the bank purchasing government debt.\n\nDraghi revealed the 24-strong governing council was split over the package of new measures, but said a \"comfortable majority\" was in favour. It is thought that Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, was opposed.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference following the decision, he said the eurozone's member states were also divided over QE.\n\n\"QE was discussed. Some members of the governing council were in favour of doing more, and some members were in favour of doing less. So our proposals strike the mid road.\" Draghi said interest rates would not be cut further.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said: \"With another rate cut, an ABS purchasing programme and a new covered bond purchasing programme, the ECB has now reached a point at which fully fledged QE, ie outright purchases of government bonds, is the only option left.\"\n\nThe ECB nudged down its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 0.9%, from an earlier forecast of 1%. It also revised down its growth forecasts for 2015 to 1.6%, from 1.7%, but it revised up its forecast for 2016 to 1.9%, from 1.8%.\n\nIt lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 0.6% from a previous forecast of 0.7%, but Draghi said policymakers did not expect outright deflation, despite a current inflation rate of just 0.3%.\n\nThe ECB left its inflation forecast for 2015 and 2016 unchanged at 1.1% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nThere was zero growth in the eurozone economy in the second quarter, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter.

Grabbing his suitcase and emptying his savings account by bashing a money-block with his head, Refugee Mario hands his funds to traffickers, undergoes a perilous Mediterranean crossing (thank goodness he has multiple lives), evades border-patrolling soldiers eager to lock him up and finally reaches the dubious sanctuary of a refugee camp.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Syrian Super Mario video on YouTube\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mutfi \u2013 who himself fled Homs for Istanbul in 2011 \u2013 said: \u201cFive months ago, my best friend drowned in the sea while travelling from Turkey to Greece: the engine on the boat exploded. That\u2019s when I got the idea for the video. It needed to be a simple and clear idea that would work irrespective of language. I used Super Mario because it\u2019s famous all over the world. It\u2019s like music \u2013 a universal language.\u201d\n\nMutfi, now working for a Turkish outfit, Online for Media, fled Homs after two of his brothers were killed. He has since made a number of animations parodying Assad\u2019s speeches, having discovered that he can mimic his voice uncannily. Which may \u2013 along with his Syrian Super Mario video \u2013 have made him a marked man. But that doesn\u2019t worry him: \u201cWe used to live in Syria without any dignity or freedom, but we don\u2019t have anything now. It\u2019s so disappointing to see what is happening with this refugee crisis. It\u2019s life or death. We have to make our own futures.\u201d\n\nMutfi\u2019s Syrian Super Mario video is timely in one respect: last Friday, Nintendo released Super Mario Maker for Wii U, which lets gamers make their own Super Mario Bros levels \u2013 so anyone with a Wii U can use Mutfi\u2019s efforts for inspiration. Could the \u201cuniversal language\u201d of gaming \u2013 which we know Cameron understands \u2013 be the medium that finally prompts the PM to take decisive action on Syria?

We did warn you this was a highly subjective list.\n\n\n\n20. Galak Z (PC/PS4)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Can you deal with disaster? Galak Z will tell you either way.\n\nThe aesthetic is borrowed from 1980s Saturday morning cartoons, the kind where a boyish Japanese hero space pilot takes down the hulking alien monster while successfully negotiating a field of asteroids. Yet, behind the bluster, this is a game about learning how to deal with disaster when, for example, you\u2019re quaking in some forsaken space cave, shields depleted, wondering how on earth you can make it home to the mothership in one piece. Designed by Jake Kazdal, who worked alongside Tetsuya Mizuguchi on the seminal shooter Rez, it\u2019s a good-looking game too. But the real beauty lies in the disasters into which you\u2019re thrusted even if, for some players, their demands will be a little too stratospheric.\n\n19. N++ (PS4)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arcade rhythms \u2026 N++.\n\nThe arcade rhythms of N++ are almost instinctively familiar. This is a game in which you repeat the same actions, time and again, in a quest to master spatial reasoning. Your character, a diminutive ninja, lives for just 90 seconds. In that time, you must attempt to traverse five deadly rooms. It\u2019s not the most novel or affecting premise, and yet, N++ feels freshly essential (as well as bulky: there are around two thousand challenge rooms to tackle). As with all the very best twitch classics, the journey from beginner to master is told not via new abilities for your avatar, but rather in your hands and muscle memory. You leave an expert \u2013 albeit one in a uselessly particular dimension.\n\n18. Tales from Borderlands (multiple formats)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tragedy and belly laughs: Tales from the Borderlands.\n\nLike Traveller\u2019s Tales with the Lego titles, Telltale provides a factory production line capable of taking any gaming, movie or television franchise and turning it into something smart, entertaining and often hilarious. Though Game of Thrones and Minecraft: Story Mode also shined this year, it\u2019s this spin off from the Gearbox RPG shooters that we really enjoyed, thanks to its excellent characters, genuinely funny script and expert understanding of a narrative universe where tragedy and belly laughs are only ever a laser blast apart.\n\n17. Invisible Inc (PC/Mac/PS4)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Invisible Inc\n\nA title pun worthy of the purest stealth game this year, Invisible Inc. also boasts greater beauty and urgency than any turn-based strategy title has a right to. You have 72 hours to save your spy agency by infiltrating 2074\u2019s megacorps, siphoning power and funds with the odds firmly stacked against you, even with a vital rewind function. Its recent expansion doubled the length of a campaign already worth revisiting due to its extensive customisation and character selection; who you bring along will radically alter your playstyle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Mario Maker Photograph: Nintendo\n\nAt one time or another, we\u2019ve all secretly thought: \u2018Hey, that Shigeru Miyamoto is a complete hack; I could do better.\u2019 Well now we have a chance. Super Mario Maker is a deceptively powerful creation tool, allowing just about anyone to construct their own platforming levels and share them with the world. Although it\u2019s deep and complex, Nintendo knows how to design an interface that works, so making stuff is as much fun as playing. Of course, we all immediately realise that Miyamoto is in fact a genius, but maybe that\u2019s the point.", "sentiment": {"score": 0.5, "magnitude": 0.5}, "time": "00:00:00", "raw_text": "Keith Stuart", "entities": {"Ed Aarons": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Dredge": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Alison Flood": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Rachel Obordo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Keith Stuart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jonathan Jones": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "none": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Joseph Harker": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Rupert Higham": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Shiv Malik": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Patrick Harkin": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Tamsin Blanchard": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Barry Glendenning": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Larry Elliott": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jemima Kiss": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Steve Boxer": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jill Treanor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Dugdale": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Daniel Taylor": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "John Butler": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Julia Carrie Wong": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Gillett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Sibylla Brodzinsky": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Marcus Christenson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Caroline Davies": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Staff": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Jacob Steinberg": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Katie Allen": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Campbell": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Angela Monaghan": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Hannah Summers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Stuart Richardson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Simon Burnton": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Hunter": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nick Fletcher": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Mark Dobson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paolo Bandini": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Graeme Wearden": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Phillip Inman": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Raphael Honigstein": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Ian Mccourt": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Nils Pratley": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Andy Robertson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Readers": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Amy Lawrence": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Heather Stewart": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Paul Doyle": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Guardian Sport": {"wiki": null, "type": "OTHER", "salience": 1}, "Julia Kollewe": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Samuel Gibbs": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Oscar Rickett": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Chris Dring": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Kate Connolly": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Godfrey Hodgson": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}, "Lorenzo Tondo": {"wiki": null, "type": "PERSON", "salience": 1}}}], "2015-11-23": [{"author": "Call of Duty: Black Ops III\n\n(PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PC, Activision, cert: 18)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAfter so many releases, Activision\u2019s adherence to the \u201cit ain\u2019t broke\u201d rule for COD will be obvious to even the most uninterested observer and hence bemoaning the cookie-cutter nature of a new Call of Duty game seems almost as routine as the experience of playing it.\n\nSo here we are then \u2013 Call of Duty: Black Ops III. It\u2019s the near future and soldiers are as well-oiled and deadly as the weapons they carry \u2013 cybernetic limbs and all. The dystopian veneer is entertaining, but before long you\u2019re back to the familiar cycle of shoot, move, take cover, repeat. Meanwhile, the story bounces around between ludicrous events and ideas with little consideration for coherence.\n\nCharacter creation is now a feature of both single and multiplayer, though it offers a fairly paltry amount of actual creativity. Multiplayer maps and game types are extremely well designed and the introduction of skill trees opens up a new level of depth to the usual experience, while Zombie modes are as silly as ever. Simply put, Activision has stuck to the rules, so if you liked Call of Duty before, this is for you. If you didn\u2019t, try something else. SR\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Tennis Ultra Smash takes the game to extremes.\n\nMario Tennis: Ultra Smash\n\n(Wii U, Nintendo cert: 3)\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nFreed from the oppressive shackles of mimicking reality, Nintendo sports games usually enjoy the freedom to be as playful and creative as imagination allows. Sadly, in the case of Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, that frequently brilliant sense of adventure is missing. Essentially, this is identical to the enjoyable 2012 Mario Tennis Open 3DS game, albeit stripped down to the bare bones. It looks slightly prettier (as expected) but it\u2019s missing a third of the characters, the gear customisation, the special bonus games, Mii support and even a basic functional tournament mode.\n\nInstead, we have Toad throwing players Mega Mushrooms that turn them into giants when collected, but which only serve to slow the pace of the match because the now-overgrown players can simply cover too much court. The core gameplay is still entertaining, but there is no escaping the fact that this is a content-light and lazy instalment of the series that brings nothing new of value to the table. RH\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Style Boutique 2: Fashion Forward allows gamers to style a whole city.\n\nNew Style Boutique 2: Fashion Forward\n\n(3DS, Nintendo, cert: 3)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFollowing on from the surprise hit that was the original New Style Boutique, Fashion Forward expands this endearingly playful garment industry challenge. Here, budding fashionistas take charge of not only a miniature store but also the surrounding Beaumonde City, where hairdressing, makeup and doll\u2019s-house design join the expert outfit selection.\n\nAssessing customers\u2019 tastes is still key and essential for those all-important repeat sales. The city location is fully exploited, with a day-night cycle that sees shopper requirements flowing from coffee-shop chic to rock-concert glam. Topping off the experience are online features including a challenge to pick a themed outfit that is then voted on by other players.\n\nProgress can be a little sedate, with some aspects only available after considerable perseverance. Also strange is the absence of men\u2019s fashion, which featured \u2013 albeit lightly \u2013 in the original. However, these niggles fail by a lengthy catwalk to eclipse the huge amount of entertainment and challenge on offer in Fashion Forward.
