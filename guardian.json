It\u2019s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty,\u201d he said.\n\nDraghi predicted that Brexit would raise about questions about eurozone sovereignty. Last year, the ECB lost a legal fight to have the clearing of euro-denominated securities moved from London to the eurozone, and Draghi suggested that legislators might want to consider changing the law.\n\n\u201cIf, in the long run, the risk of a less open UK economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialise, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition, and thus, productivity and potential output,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch developments would first and foremost weigh on the UKeconomy.\u201d\n\nBank of England prepares to protect City firms from hard Brexit Read more\n\nAt the weekend, it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had held talks with senior City figures about negotiating a \u201ctransitional arrangement\u201d to protect financial companies from the dangers of suddenly losing full membership of the single market.\n\nParesh Davdra, the chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, said central bankers were becoming frustrated that elected politicians were not pulling their weight.\n\n\u201cDraghi\u2019s comments likely reflect a frustration that Carney will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfil certain roles that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable,\u201d Davdra said.\n\n\u201cDraghi\u2018s comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, in his call for the prime minister, Theresa May, to share more about the Brexit strategy, days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the case of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019.\u201d"]], "2016-02-29": [[["Katie Allen"], "00:00:00", "The European Central Bank is under growing pressure to step up support for the eurozone\u2019s flagging economy after the bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February.\n\nThe surprise drop in prices marked the third time in a year that inflation has turned negative, fanning fears that the eurozone is headed for all-out deflation \u2013 a sustained period of falling prices. The news cemented market expectations that the ECB would use its meeting next week to inject fresh cash into the single currency bloc and to cut a key interest rate further into negative territory.\n\nCentral bankers on the defensive as weird policy becomes even weirder Read more\n\nHeadline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January, according to an early estimate from statistics office Eurostat. That contrasted with forecasts for a reading of zero in a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nLow energy prices were the main factor behind the drop, but price pressures in other areas of the economy played a part. There was also a drop in core inflation \u2013 taken as a guide to underlying price \u2013 adding to signs that low inflation was becoming more entrenched as eurozone economies battled with sluggish global demand from a fresh slowdown and the lingering impact of the last financial crisis.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of unprocessed food and energy, fell more than expected to 0.8% from 1% in January and was its lowest since April last year.\n\nEconomists said the inflation numbers raised questions over the firepower of central banks to revive growth and prices. Deflation concerns central bank policymakers because it can lead to consumers delaying spending in the anticipation of good becoming cheaper, creating a cycle of diminishing demand that hits economic growth.\n\nThis year will be the fourth year of inflation undershooting the ECB\u2019s target of close to 2%, said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at French banking group Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. There were no limits to the ECB\u2019s willingness \u201cbut clear limits to its effectiveness\u201d, he said. \u201cDespite its best efforts, the ECB\u2019s challenge to break the backbone of lowflation remains a tall order. Looking set to miss its target for a fourth year this year, we expect it to miss it for another four years, at least, without the help of more substantial economic reform. That won\u2019t stop the ECB from doing what it must according to its self-imposed target, but with markets increasingly unconvinced, we are approaching the \u2018effective\u2019 limit of the ECB\u2019s tools.\u201d\n\nThe inflation figures follow warnings from the IMF and the OECD that governments cannot rely on low interest rates and money-printing programmes to shore up growth. A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of countries ended with a similar statement that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But the policymakers failed to come up with a concrete plan of how they might revive a sluggish world economy.\n\nThe Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used his speech at the Shanghai meeting to insist central bankers still had ammunition left to boost growth. But he too argued for more help from governments.\n\n\n\nThis week marks seven years of UK interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate further but has ruled out following the trend seen in other countries for negative rates, where depositors are effectively charged for parking their money. The Bank of Japan recently joined the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, amid signs of a strongly growing US economy. But a string of poor economic figures since then raised doubts about any future rate-rises and even prompted some economists to speculate the move could be reversed.\n\nThe ECB meets again next week to decide its next move and its chief, Mario Draghi, has already indicated the central bank will announce moves to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone. Economists expect the Frankfurt-based body to expand its quantitative easing programme \u2013 where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u2013 and to further cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. Another reduction in the deposit rate means it would be charging banks more to hold their money overnight.\n\n\n\nThe weak core inflation figure \u201cpretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing\u201d at next week\u2019s meeting, said Teunis Brosens at ING bank. \u201cThe weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u2018inflate away\u2019 their debt burden by increasing nominal wages,\u201d Brosens said."]], "2016-02-19": [[["Andy Hunter"], "00:00:00", "\u2022 Italian striker, now on loan at Milan, linked with Chinese Super League \u2022 Naming rights for new stand could raise up to \u00a390m\n\nLiverpool are hoping for financial windfalls from south-east Asia after holding talks over a main stand naming rights deal and with Mario Balotelli the latest big-name player wanted in the Chinese Super League.\n\nBalotelli is on a season\u2019s loan at Milan but does not feature in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s plans at Liverpool and will be offloaded on a permanent basis this summer providing a taker can be found.

To guard against a drop in price expectations, \"more pre-emptive action may be warranted\", he said.\n\nDraghi's comments follow suggestions from other ECB policymakers that the bank is ready to act at its policy meeting on 5 June to counter low inflation and weak lending in the 18-country eurozone. Draghi said he expected inflation, which is running at 0.7%, to return slowly to the ECB's target of just under 2%.\n\n\"Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do,\" he said at the ECB's Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. \"What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is, in my view, the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.\"\n\nSetting out policy options for different scenarios, Draghi said that should exchange rate or market developments result in an unwarranted tightening of monetary and financial conditions \"this would require adjustment of our conventional instruments\".

This is far more than markets had been expecting, although it was also reported that no formal decision had been taken and the numbers could still change. Draghi is due to announce the unprecedented measures at a press conference at ECB headquarters in Frankfurt at 1.30pm UK time.\n\nThere are concerns, however, that it is too little, too late. Growth in the 19-nation eurozone has been lacklustre, and the currency bloc slipped into deflation in December, when prices fell by 0.2%, the first annual decline for five years.\n\nNick Kounis at ABN Amro said: \u201cWe think that the QE programme needs to be towards the upper end of the range to impress financial markets, and this looks increasingly likely. As well as government bonds, other securities, such as agency debt and corporate bonds could well be included.\u201d\n\nDraghi and his colleagues on the ECB governing council have been discussing the possibility of pumping money into the eurozone banking system, by acquiring government debt from financial institutions, since the summer.

British holidaymakers planning a spring break on the continent also received a fillip, as the euro lost more than 1% of its value against the pound, with a euro now worth just 75p.\n\nThe \u20ac60bn-a-month price tag for the QE programme, which will start in March, was larger than many in financial markets had expected, and underlined Draghi\u2019s determination to hold the 19-member currency zone together. The banker, nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d by traders, promised QE would continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d.\n\nThe ECB is meant to keep inflation below, but close to, its target level of 2% \u2013 but prices have been rising at less than half that pace for the past year, against a background of plunging oil prices and anaemic growth. With average prices in the shops already falling across the single currency area, the ECB hopes to avoid the threat of a deflationary spiral, in which consumers and businesses slash spending while they wait for prices to fall further, dragging the economy into a recession.\n\nSpeaking in Frankfurt Draghi said: \u201cThe risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside, but should have diminished after today\u2019s monetary policy decisions and the continued fall in oil prices over recent weeks.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited launch of QE will infuriate Berlin, which views the policy as akin to a bailout for free-spending governments such as Greece, and fears that it could allow inflation to get out of control. A headline on the website of the newspaper Bild after the announcement read: \u201cECB takes billions of debt off ailing euro states: What happens to my money now?\u201d\n\nDraghi said the decision of the ECB\u2019s governing council was made with \u201cso large a majority that no vote was necessary\u201d, but that suggested that the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, had stuck by his longstanding opposition to QE.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said: \u201cIt does not surprise me that there is a contentious debate within the ECB. The world is already well supplied with liquidity. Regardless of what the ECB does, it should not obscure the fact that the real growth impulses must come from conditions set by the politicians.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers in the US and the UK have used QE to restore confidence and unblock financial markets since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009, but the ECB had been reluctant to follow suit in the face of German opposition and fears that it could unleash inflation.\n\nA slowdown in the eurozone, Britain\u2019s major export market, is one of the key risks to UK economic recovery.\n\nGeorge Osborne said: \u201cThe fact that the ECB had to take this drastic action shows the European economy is much weaker than the UK economy and it\u2019s also a warning to Britain of the risks that lie ahead if we were to abandon our long term economic plan.\u201d\n\nJohn Cridland, director general of the CBI, welcomed Draghi\u2019s move: \u201cAt the moment, flagging eurozone economies are dragging on UK and world growth. Quantitative easing will give the Eurozone recovery a much-needed boost, which should also have a positive economic effect in the UK.\u201d\n\nChristine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, which cut its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy last week, said QE should \u201chelp lower borrowing costs across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation\u201d.\n\nThe \u20ac60bn-a-month total for the QE programme includes the purchase of private sector assets that the ECB had already begun, to try to unlock credit markets.\n\nDraghi echoed Merkel\u2019s call for national governments to take their own steps to kickstart growth, stressing that QE alone would not repair the eurozone economy. \u201cWhat monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth, but for growth to pick up you need investment, for investment you need confidence, and for confidence you need structural reforms.\u201d\n\nSony Kapoor, of the thinktank Re-Define, called on eurozone governments to respond by relaxing austerity policies and increasing public spending, to create demand and restore economic growth.\n\n\u201cToday the ECB has finally arrived as a truly \u2018European\u2019 Central Bank. It has acted against political opposition to deliver what is by most measures an ambitious programme of quantitative easing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ECB has finally, if belatedly, done its part. Now it\u2019s time for the eurozone to relax the fiscal constraint.\n\nDraghi ridiculed the doomsayers predicting that hyperinflation would eventually result from QE, saying that hawks had repeatedly warned about inflation taking off each time the ECB had cut interest rates \u2013 yet inflation remained very low. He said there should be a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d on such warnings.\n\nThe ECB had already announced, in a statement earlier on Thursday, that it would leave its main interest rate unchanged at 0.05%.\n\nIn a concession to German reservations, Draghi promised that national central banks would bear much of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d between member countries. Some analysts fear that could dent the effectiveness of the policy.\n\nIn an aside that will be heard loud and clear in Athens, Draghi also warned: \u201cSome additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme.\u201d\n\nThat could allow the ECB to exclude Greek bonds from QE if, for example, the populist Syriza party wins Sunday\u2019s general election and ditches the austerity programme imposed by its creditors."], [["John Butler"], "00:00:00", "Two and a half years have passed since Mario Draghi promised to do \u201cwhat it takes\u201d to save the euro. But it took until Thursday for him to get around to doing what his counterparts in Washington, London and Tokyo did long ago \u2013 and set the printing presses whirring in the battle against economic depression.\n\nThe president of the European Central Bank is, even though such a technocrat would deny it, an accomplished politician. It\u2019s just as well: he has to be. At his press conference, the upbeat Italian set out a large, if heavily rule-bound, bond-buying scheme which represented the best that he could wring out of the eurozone\u2019s sclerotic architecture of economic governance.\n\nThe headline commitment, to purchase \u20ac60bn in assets with made-up money each month, cheered the markets because it was \u20ac10bn more than the \u20ac50bn that had been artfully trailed. The successful spin could unravel \u2013 especially if it emerges that German resistance to starting the scheme at this moment was fierce. \u201cAdditional eligibility criteria\u201d for countries in receipt of IMF help confirmed the lack of any spirit of solidarity towards Greece, days ahead of that country\u2019s plebiscite on years of Euro-austerity. Arcane, and ultimately second order, negotiations about how losses for purely hypothetical defaults by other states might be shared across the continent went to the wire.\n\nBut from this haggling Mr Draghi rescued a tolerable if unsatisfactory fudge, and on two other details that could have turned devilish, he notched up victories. He announced the unanimous recognition by his board, which includes two German members, that the sort of quantitative easing he is embarking on is a legitimate tool of the trade. A settled ECB view that the Draghi plan rests on proper authority is useful to have in the face of ongoing legal arguments, which resonate in Berlin, about the bank going beyond its powers. His second win was to avoid getting ensnared in an arbitrary time limit, announcing that bond buying would continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d, which \u2013 when translated from central bank jargon \u2013 means for as long as it takes.\n\nBut as long as it takes to do what? The immediate, and the only explicit, objective is to restore consumer prices, which are now actually sinking, to annual growth of something approaching 2%. This matters because of the desperate need to shrug off the wider European stagnation, which deflation both symbolises and threatens to intensify. Unchecked it will swell the real value of debts, weighing down mortgaged families and the businesses that the eurozone desperately needs to invest. Bond buying will not on its own guarantee any recovery in economic spirits, but Europe has reached a pass where a continuing failure to act would have virtually guaranteed that the mood would not lift.\n\nThere are myriad theories about exactly how QE works \u2013 from inspiring workers to demand a pay rise, to enticing financiers to lend to companies instead of just governments \u2013 most of them dubious. Many of the Fed\u2019s freshly minted QE dollars have ended up swelling New York hedge funds, while the wand waved by the Bank of England has worked more magic in the South Kensington property market than anywhere else. But however perverse it may be to reward the speculating classes who had such a hand in the original crisis, it is preferable to sitting idly by while purchasing power shrivels away. Until , the record of the ECB was worse than passivity \u2013 it has spent most of the past two years contracting its balance sheet, and with it the real value of the money in circulation. And as the US and the UK economies have falteringly chugged back to life, the eurozone has remain utterly stalled.\n\nA powerful case can be made that it would not only be fairer but more expansionary too if instead of embracing a conventional QE programme, the ECB had been more creative \u2013 and lent straight to expanding employers, directly bank-rolled investment in public infrastructure, or simply credited cash into regular citizens\u2019 accounts. Europe, however, is not in imaginative mood. It currently needs all the energy it can muster just to survive. At least it showed on Thursday that it is not in the grip of a death wish."]], "2014-06-01": [[["Phillip Inman"], "00:00:00", "Europe's banks were bracing themselves over the weekend for much anticipated cuts in the eurozone's commercial interest rates to boost the currency zone's struggling economy.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) boss Mario Draghi is expected to reduce the rate at which commercial banks borrow from 0.25% to 0.15% to encourage business lending.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based institution is also expected to cut the interest rate it pays to banks that keep funds on deposit in a further move to discourage lenders from hoarding cash.\n\nDraghi is under pressure to kickstart bank lending after recent figures showed that Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Portugal saw their economies contract in the first three months of the year while France stagnated. Only Germany prevented the eurozone from heading back into recession after after a 0.8% growth spurt.\n\nLow inflation across the 18 members of the currency zone has also discouraged shoppers from spending on the high street and undermined business investment and union-led attempts to raise wages.\n\nIn April inflation rose to 0.7 from 0.5% in March, but remained in what the ECB calls the \"danger zone\" of below 1%, and well below the ECB's target of close to 2%.\n\nWorse still, figures for May showed that Italy's EU-harmonised inflation rate eased to a weaker-than-expected 0.4% year-on-year from 0.5% in April. Corresponding inflation in Spain was 0.2%, down from 0.3%.\n\nBut the ECB is unlikely to mimic the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England and pump billions of euros into the banking system with a programme of quantitative easing (QE).\n\nThe ECB, which will announce its decision on Thursday, is known to have come close to voting for QE, but conservative forces on the governing council have resisted the plans.\n\n\"We are aware of the risks of a too prolonged low inflation period,\" Draghi told an ECB conference outside Lisbon last week, adding that he and his colleagues had to be \"particularly watchful\" for any negative price spiral.\n\nAt the last policy meeting in May, Draghi said the ECB was comfortable with acting in June if updated staff forecasts showed the situation remained the same or worse.\n\n\"Draghi's May press conference raised market expectations of action, and the ECB will want to appear bold,\" said Nikolaus Keis, economist at Unicredit. \"The risk is that monetary conditions may quickly start tightening anew if the ECB's moves are perceived as too timid.\"\n\nHoward Archer, chief European economist at HS Global Insight, said economic conditions in the eurozone \"certainly justify strong action\".\n\nIn the absence of further monetary support, the euro would rise against the dollar, hurting exporters and deterring business investment, he said.\n\n\"Ever since Mr. Draghi's comments after the 8 May ECB policy meeting that the ECB is \"comfortable\" with taking action in June to counter prolonged very low eurozone inflation and the strength of the euro, it has looked much more likely than not that the bank will follow through and move at its 5 June policy meeting.\n\nHe added: \"However, we remain doubtful that the ECB will undertake full blown QE. We suspect this will only happen if eurozone consumer price inflation falls to new lows below 0.5% over the coming months and eurozone growth falters further.\""], [["Larry Elliott"], "00:00:00", "The European Central Bank governor has charmed the markets with words. But this week he must make bold policy decisions to unite a region increasingly riven by economic disparities\n\nThe meeting will be held on the day before the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, but make no mistake: Thursday is D-day for the European Central Bank. That's D as in Draghi, because after all of the ECB governor's silver-tongued manipulation of the market \u2013 all the nudges, winks and hints \u2013 the financial markets now require Mario Draghi to do more than just talk.\n\nExpectations are high, probably unrealistically so. After the bloody nose received by mainstream parties in last week's elections to the European parliament, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers had some harsh things to say on US news network CNN about the mess that policymakers had made of things: \"The European common market, European monetary union, was an elitist project that was driven by elites, that led to consequences that were entirely unpredicted by elites, that have been catastrophic for millions of people.\"\n\nDraghi can do little to rekindle love for the idea of ever-closer union in Europe \u2013 a project damaged, perhaps beyond repair, by recession, unemployment and austerity. Nor is he in a position to eradicate the structural problems of the euro \u2013 its one-size-fits-all interest rates, its inbuilt deflationary tendencies \u2013 that have been obvious since its creation. These are beyond his remit. The \"elite\" lambasted by Summers has to decide whether to press ahead with closer fiscal integration \u2013 a centralised budget that might make the single currency work better \u2013 in the face of clear voter hostility to greater unity.\n\nInstead, the ECB meeting will have a less ambitious, but still crucial, agenda. As Investec economist Philip Shaw puts it, Europe's central bank has four key objectives this week: \"To ease policy to meet its inflation target; to prevent inflation expectations from being dislodged to the downside and increasing the risks of deflation; to stem upward pressure on the euro; and to secure and preferably speed up the recovery, possibly by encouraging credit flow.\"\n\nThis is not just a question of preventing the eurozone from becoming the new Japan \u2013 where activity is relentlessly weak and both consumers and businesses are deterred from spending by the knowledge that deflation will lead to prices being lower in the future than they are today. The ECB also has to take into account that some parts of the eurozone have suffered from Great Depression-style falls in output since 2008 and that many economies are operating way below pre-recession levels.\n\nWhat's more, the big discrepancies in economic performance across the eurozone \u2013 especially between Germany and France \u2013 will put increasing strains on the central bank.\n\nEstimates by the Centre for Economic and Business Research suggest Greek economic output will be more than 23% lower at the end of 2014 than it was in 2008. Italy, Spain and Portugal will have seen declines of 7%, 6% and 6% respectively while even Ireland, the poster child for austerity, will still be operating 4% below its pre-recession level.\n\nThe eurozone emerged from double-dip recession a year ago, but its recovery has been modest. Exports have been hampered by the slowdown in the global economy and by the strength of the euro. Investment has been constrained by the unwillingness or inability of banks to lend. Unemployment, which averages 12% across the eurozone, has discouraged consumer spending.\n\nLatest data suggests that consumer and business confidence is picking up, but even so, growth this year currently looks like coming in at around 1% \u2013 not fast enough to prevent disinflationary pressure from growing. The cost of living across the 18-nation single-currency area rose at an annual rate of 0.7% in April, well below the ECB's target of \"below but close to 2%\". The bank will publish its own forecasts for inflation on Tuesday, but markets anticipate that it will pencil in a figure of only around 1.3% for 2016. That leaves Draghi with plenty of scope for action and he said at last month's ECB meeting that he and his fellow policymakers would feel \"comfortable\" with acting next time.\n\nAll that is at issue is what form of the attempted policy stimulus will take. There are three possibilities:\n\n\u25a0 Cut interest rates First on the list will be lowering rates. Borrowing costs in the eurozone are already close to zero but Draghi will go further. The ECB's refinancing rate \u2013 the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from Frankfurt \u2013 is currently 0.25% and a cut to 0.15% is widely predicted.\n\nOf rather greater interest will be what Draghi does to the deposit rate \u2013 the interest banks get when they lodge money with the ECB. The strong speculation is that at this week's meeting it will become the first major central bank in the world to announce a negative rate, probably -0.1%. What that means is that will cost banks money to deposit money at the ECB. The hope is that they will lend the money out instead.\n\n\u25a0 Boost lending The second item on the agenda will be whether more targeted steps need to be taken to boost lending, especially in some of the weaker countries on the eurozone's periphery. Draghi has noted that it is much harder for good businesses to get access to credit in Spain than it is in Germany, with figures showing that 25% of viable Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises are constrained by a lack of finance, compared with just 1% in Germany.\n\nHere, the ECB is likely to come up with its own version of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which gave banks access to cheaper credit but only on condition that it was lent rather than hoarded. In the past, the ECB has used long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide help to eurozone banks: a more targeted LTRO looks likely this week.\n\n\u25a0 Start printing money The really big question is whether the ECB is prepared to go the whole hog and announce its own quantitative easing programme, something already tried by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.\n\nMost analysts believe the threat of deflation would need to get more serious before the ECB took this step, although Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics thinks that, to end an economic and financial struggle that is now longer-lasting than the second world war, QE will ultimately be required.\n\n\"We still think a bolder programme of asset purchases will be necessary to get the recovery going and avoid prolonged deflation,\" she says.\n\nCountry by country: how invididual economies are faring\n\nGermany Europe's biggest economy began 2014 strongly, fuelling hopes it could drag the eurozone with it. Growth hit a three-year high \u2013 but the recovery appears to be slowing. Business confidence dipped last month after exports fell by the largest amount in 11 months.\n\nFrance The new \"sick man of Europe\" is exhibiting some alarming symptoms as it falls further behind its neighbours. The economy stagnated in the first quarter of 2014, and unemployment hit another record high in April. No surprise that only 3% of the population wants President Hollande to run again in 2017.\n\nItaly Almost 10% was wiped off the size of Italy's economy after a 27-month recession that only ended last autumn. Charismatic prime minister Matteo Renzi now promises reforms to make Italy more competitive. But, worryingly, the economy went into reverse again between January and March.\n\nSpain The Spanish economy is finally heading in the right direction, after its banking sector was propped up by a \u20ac41bn bailout programme. But its jobless rate remains a stain on the eurozone recovery, with more than one in four adults still out of work.\n\nPortugal Lisbon emerged from its bailout programme last month, but faces many more years of cutbacks if Portugal is to hit its deficit targets. The national debt is now a concerning 129% of national output; no wonder economists were alarmed that GDP shrank by 0.7% in the last quarter.\n\nGreece The six-year depression is expected to end this year, and Greece made a remarkably successful return to the bond markets in April. But political uncertainty is mounting: with the coalition's majority down to just two, could Athens be forced into an early election?\n\nIreland After three traumatic years, Ireland successfully left its bailout programme last December. But years of cuts lie ahead \u2013 former Taoiseach John Bruton predicts another 10 years of austerity budgets unless growth accelerates. Workers are suffering a wage squeeze, with average earnings falling in May.\n\nCyprus The island is struggling to return to normal after the trauma of last year's bailout, which sent it into a deep recession. There are still strict restrictions on transferring money overseas, and Cypriot ministers have warned the economy would suffer badly if tougher sanctions were imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.\n\nSlovenia Tough austerity and privatisations have helped maintain investors' confidence and shored up its banking sector. But they cost prime minister Alenka Bratusek the leadership of her party. A snap general election is coming in July, raising fears that Slovenia's reform programme could stumble.\n\nAustria Austria epitomises the classic northern core of the eurozone, with the lowest jobless rate of any member of the single currency. But its economy may be hitting a sticky patch \u2013 manufacturers report that new orders are stagnating.\n\nFinland Conditions have deteriorated since 2012 \u2013 the country has tumbled into recession and economists fear it may not pull out until 2015. With household debt rising and firms regularly issuing profit warnings, Finland is no longer a model to the rest of Europe.\n\nNetherlands A housing market crash has left many households deep in negative equity. That's hitting consumer spending, with retail sales slumping by 2.2% in March. Like Finland, the Dutch economy has deteriorated just as the southern periphery has improved.\n\nGraeme Wearden"]], "2015-04-16": [[["Kate Connolly"], "00:00:00", "\n\nThe German activist who charged at ECB President Mario Draghi at a press conference, tossing confetti over him and shouting \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d, has said she was shocked at how easy it had been to carry out her stunt.\n\n\u201dI was stunned and surprised at how well it worked out and that I managed to get inside the building at all.

It is unclear whether the ECB will press charges against her.\n\nShe said that after last month\u2019s protests outside the ECB\u2019s new headquarters, in which anti-austerity demonstrators clashed with police, she had wanted to stage her own peaceful demonstration inside the bank.\n\n\u201dAfter the aggressive police tactics used outside the ECB, I wanted to show a positive way of non-radical, peaceful protest inside the devil\u2019s den,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat could have been better than dancing on the table of that unelected man in his ivory tower?\n\n\u201cThe picture of Mario Draghi\u2019s face was priceless \u2013 he was scared, surprised and shaken, and gone was the big poker-faced banker \u2013 it was suddenly just an ordinary man there in front of me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted to demonstrate is that economics are not just some god-given thing that we have to accept and go along with. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d\n\nWitt said she was convinced that Europe needed a \u201cnew narrative\u201d. \u201cWe have this image that the northern countries are disciplined and hard-working and the southern countries are just lying on the beach doing nothing. This is a racist narrative that\u2019s dividing our united Europe. The ECB and the troika is only feeding into this, but we can\u2019t let it divide our continent.\u201d\n\nShe said she was also angry at the economic imbalances that have emerged since the financial crisis began, balances which had also affected Germany. \u201cJust as it\u2019s untrue to say the Greeks are lying on their backs, neither is it true that all Germans are rich,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gap between the rich and the poor is bigger here than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d\n\nWitt is part of the European feminist Femen protest movement and has previously participated in high-profile attacks against Vladimir Putin at a trade fair in Hanover, a topless protest in Tunisia for which she spent four weeks in jail, and a Christmas Day protest in Cologne Cathedral for which she is still going through a court process. But in Frankfurt she insists, she was acting alone.\n\n\u201cIt was refreshing to know that under the right circumstances I could get just as good a response by not staging a topless action,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the response alone I got from people all round the world, I think it was a big success.\n\n\u201cI got tonnes of emails, some blogposts about me, from Canada to Australia people were congratulating me and thankful for what I did, and that made it worth it.

Are we finished here? The answer is no.\n\n\"If required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. The governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.\"\n\nThe decision to impose a negative deposit rate on banks was described as a \"bold and unusual move\" by Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight.\n\nTrevor Greetham, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: \"Draghi handsomely beat expectations by adopting all of the measures under discussion and leaving the door open to future QE by way of asset purchases if they need to boost growth further or turn sentiment around in a crisis situation.\"\n\nAction was widely predicted by analysts and markets amid a mounting threat that persistently low inflation in the 18-nation eurozone could lead to outright deflation. But it was unclear what form it would take.\n\nData published by the EU's statistics office revealed an unexpected fall in the annual rate of eurozone inflation to 0.5% in May from 0.7% in April, which appeared to seal the deal for more ECB stimulus.\n\nWith a lack of inflationary pressure amid a weak economic recovery, the fear is the eurozone will slide into a destructive deflation trap, where consumers and businesses delay spending in anticipation of lower prices in the future.\n\nThe ECB also lowered its eurozone inflation forecasts to 2016. Draghi said the annual rate was expected to stay at low levels in the coming months and would only rise gradually through 2015 and 2016. Inflation is expected to reach 1.5% by the final quarter of 2016. However, he played down the threat of deflation. \"We don't see deflation, a self-fulfilling negative spiral.\"\n\nThe euro fell as investors digested the ECB's gloomier forecasts and the sweeping cuts in borrowing rates. But the Paris Cac and Frankfurt Dax benefited from the prospect of higher growth in the eurozone as a result of the policy shift. The Cac jumped 42 points to 4,543 and the Dax increased by 7.4 points to 9,943.\n\nBut some economists said the measures would prove to be too little, too late.\n\nMarc Ostwald, an economist at Monument Securities said: \"In theory, this should help, but as has been obvious in the UK, where borrowing by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is still quite weak and SME deposits are high, SMEs' distrust of the financial sector post the credit crisis remains very high.\"\n\nDraghi said the purpose of the June policy meeting was threefold: to ease monetary policy; enhance the impact of measures on the real economy; and reaffirm a willingness to use unconventional measures if further easing is needed.\n\nDraghi said the decision on the package was unanimous among the 24-strong governing council, which includes the governors of the national central banks of the 18 eurozone countries, signalling \"an extraordinarily unusual degree of consensus\". This indicated that Germany's Bundesbank \u2013 once unconvinced of the use of such measures \u2013 had backed the latest plan.\n\nThe Bank of England, which has already cut borrowing rates for banks and pumped \u00a3375bn of QE into the UK economy, announced at the end of its monthly meeting that it would maintain interest rates at 0.5% and the same level of QE."]], "2014-06-30": [[["Nick Gillett"], "00:00:00", "\n\nReading this on mobile?

The European Central Bank (ECB) president thus signalled, putting it crudely, readiness to print as many euros as required to prevent the bankruns and debt defaults that threatened the single currency. The printing presses didn\u2019t actually have to whirr, because \u2013 reassured that the worst case would not be allowed \u2013 the markets calmed down, borrowing costs fell, and everything got more manageable.\n\nOr at least that is the simplified story. An Italian at the helm of an institution where German power loomed large, Mr Draghi could not be seen to be allowing shaky banks and spendthrift governments off the hook, so he chose his timing carefully, and sealed an unstated grand bargain. In return for northern Europe\u2019s acquiescence in expansive monetary policy, the south would continue to swallow the painful prescriptions of austerity. The most obvious danger at the time appeared to be that the politics would come unstuck. They nearly have at times, as when the anti-austerity comic, Beppe Grillo, ran the Italian mainstream within inches of its life. The continent hammered the establishment in the Euro-elections, a resurgent French Front National remains a particularly sinister threat, and many a European street has thronged with protest. But in the end \u2013 as so often \u2013 orthodox opinion has mostly prevailed.\n\nThe imminent threat to the 2012 Draghi deal is not so much the politics, but rather the economics. The backdrop to the ECB\u2019s move last week to start buying up certain private sector securities is stubborn stagnation. Having contracted last year, output continues to shrink in many countries and growth is often anaemic where it exists. With inflation a fraction of one per cent across the continent, and prices already falling in places, Europe could sink into a deflationary quagmire, where debts weigh ever-more heavily, and consumer purchases are continually postponed in the hope of discounts down the road.\n\nLast week\u2019s reduction in the main interest rate, from 0.15% to 0.05%, underlined a policy that\u2019s running out of road. In happier days, a cut of 0.1 percentage points would have been deemed irrelevant, yet now the bank stands only half of that distance from a rate of zero. In his speech at Jackson Hole last month, Mr Draghi effectively proposed a second grand bargain, with the bank\u2019s cheap money complemented by orthodox \u201creform\u201d where required, and \u2013 more interestingly \u2013 a supportive role for fiscal policy in those more fortunate countries that are not at their overdraft limits.

This is a fast game that never wants to leave you unsure of your goals, and keeps you in stride with the superbly paced action. The AI and gameplay\u2019s age is now showing, but along with Gears\u2019s modest primitiveness there is also a clarity of purpose sometimes absent in newer shooters. The result is distinct, engrossing and well worth revisiting nine years on.

Balotelli has now scored 27 of 29 penalties in his career but Gerrard said: \u201cJordan should have taken the penalty. Rules are rules. It should have been Henderson. Mario has been a bit mischievous.\n\n\n\n\u201cCredit to Mario, he\u2019s scored,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s not nice to see when footballers are arguing. I think Jordan has handled the situation very well. He can see that Mario really wanted to score.\n\n\u201cJordan walked away at the right moment and handled his post-match interview very well.

Rules are in place for a reason.\u201d\n\nLiverpool\u2019s penalty followed a foul by Ramon Motta on Jordon Ibe, and Besiktas will be without the left-back plus the central defender Ersan Gulum for next week\u2019s second leg because of suspension. Henderson said: \u201cIt was great play by Jordon. I wanted the penalty but Mario felt confident and he has taken big penalties before. It was a great penalty in the end. It\u2019s a big goal for us.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to take them. I felt confident but so did Mario, he has taken big penalties before and he got the nod. That\u2019s a big goal for us. We know it\u2019s not done yet. There is still plenty to play for. We have to go there with the same mentality and defend like we did and look to hurt them on the break. We\u2019re happy with the result.\u201d\n\nBalotelli would later take to Instagram in an attempt to defuse the situation. He wrote: \u201cThank you hendo for let me take the penalty. Stop drama now. We won that\u2019s what it count. We are a team and especially we are Liverpool.

I believe Besiktas have scored in every away game so it shows our defensive organisation that we kept a clean sheet. Simon Mignolet made an outstanding save in the first half [from Demba Ba]. We created chances and moved the ball quicker in the second half. It was a perfect result and sets up for the second leg next week.\u201d\n\nThe Besiktas coach, Slaven Bilic, insisted the tie was far from over.\n\n\u201cOf course, when you concede a late penalty you are gutted and from our point of view it wouldn\u2019t be unfair if it finished 0-0 or 1-1,\u201d said Bilic.\u201cWe deserved a bit more but from their side they deserved maybe the one goal. They were putting from the bench really class players like Balotelli and Sterling. They were making counterattacks that were very dangerous but we are very much alive and definitely in this game.

He told us he had changed his ways. Mario Balotelli told us all the words he thought we might want to hear as he rejoined Milan on loan this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give everything.\u201d At one point, he even informed Gazzetta dello Sport that: \u201cI used to be a boy named Mario, but now I\u2019m Mario the man.\u201d\n\nIf he sounded like a spurned lover trying to win back a lost partner\u2019s approval, then perhaps that\u2019s exactly what he was. Balotelli had adored Milan since he was a child, and was not the first to frame their relationship in romantic terms. Adriano Galliani announced the striker\u2019s imminent return last August by telling reporters: \u201cSome loves never end.\u201d\n\nThe Rossoneri\u2019s chief executive is notorious for his willingness to rekindle old affairs. Such players as Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Kak\u00e1 and Roberto Donadoni have departed the club under his stewardship, only to return later in their careers. None have ever recaptured anything like their best form during their second stints with the team.\n\nJuventus restore three-point lead at top with win over Atalanta Read more\n\nSo why bother with Balotelli? He had never sparkled as brightly as the aforementioned stars in the first instance. His strike rate for Milan was robust \u2013 with 26 goals scored in 43 league appearances \u2013 and yet he had faded following a brilliant initial six-month spell. It was Balotelli who salvaged a third-place finish for Milan after joining in January 2013, but he too who collected 10 yellow cards and one red while cutting a tetchy and isolated figure during the following campaign.\n\nSince then, he had endured a dismal year at Liverpool \u2013 scoring only a single Premier League goal and falling behind Rickie Lambert in the pecking order. Milan fans were not exactly agitating for his return. In fact, there were whistles at San Siro when Balotelli\u2019s name was announced among the substitutes for the home opener against Empoli.\n\nBut there was some method to Galliani\u2019s madness. Balotelli, unlike those previous high-profile returnees, was still in his mid-20s. Besides, this was only a loan with no fee attached. In effect, Milan were getting a risk-free trial of a player they had sold for \u00a316m a year earlier, and whose best seasons could still lie ahead.\n\nThe club\u2019s new manager, furthermore, had an existing relationship with Balotelli. Sinisa Mihajlovic had been an assistant at Inter back when the player was emerging from the Nerazzurri\u2019s youth team. A private meeting was arranged between them before Milan signed off on the deal.\n\n\u201cYou will need to be the first to arrive and the last to leave,\u201d Mihajlovic was reported to have told Balotelli. \u201cYou must always give your all, otherwise I will make sure you find your suitcases waiting outside the gates of Milanello.\u201d\n\nBalotelli seemed to have taken that message on board. He put in a swashbuckling cameo off the bench during a derby defeat to Inter before marking his first start with a fine free-kick goal to open the scoring in a 3-2 win over Udinese.\n\nJust when his star was in the ascendancy, though, he was sidelined by a sports hernia. The injury, which turned out to require an operation, took Balotelli out of action from September right through to mid-January.\n\nWhen Balotelli returned, he discovered that he was no longer needed. After a difficult first half to the season, Mihajlovic had finally found an attacking partnership that worked, M\u2019Baye Niang\u2019s range and readiness to drift out and serve crosses from either flank making him the perfect foil to Carlos Bacca\u2019s penalty-box prowling.\n\nMilan went nine games without defeat, surging back into the race for European places. Where once Balotelli asked \u201cWhy always me?\u201d now he was instead left to ponder \u201cWhy never me?\u201d He averaged fewer than 13 minutes on the pitch in his first eight league games back from injury, and failed to record a single goal or assist.\n\nMihajlovic was unsympathetic to suggestions that Balotelli required more substantial opportunities to make an impact. \u201cThe number of minutes you have on the pitch do not matter,\u201d said the manager. \u201cYou can be decisive even in five. He needs to show me that he has rage and desire.\u201d\n\nThat final sentiment was the important one. Introduced for the dying moments of a 2-1 win over Genoa, Balotelli had been asked to lead the defensive effort from the front but never broke out of a jog. Only a late intervention from Milan\u2019s athletic trainer, Antonio Bovenzi, kept a furious Mihajlovic from storming over to make an example of his striker at full-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sinisa Mihajlovic said Mario Balotelli is not yet fully fit. Photograph: Elisabetta Baracchi/EPA\n\nAnd yet, after Niang damaged his ankle in a car accident last week, it was Balotelli to whom the manager turned. He was not necessarily the most obvious choice. J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez, Milan\u2019s leading scorer in 2014-15, has spent most of this season recovering from a hernia of his own but started alongside Balotelli in the Coppa Italia semi-final second leg against Alessandria on Tuesday. The Frenchman hit a pair of goals during what became a 5-0 rout.\n\nBalotelli grabbed one \u2013 just as he had done in the reverse fixture \u2013 but his performance again lacked dynamism or verve. Several newspapers identified him as the worst player in a red-and-black shirt.\n\nMihajlovic persisted, selecting Balotelli to start alongside Bacca in Sunday\u2019s match away to Sassuolo. Unlike third-tier Alessandria, these opponents were strong enough to give Milan real concerns. Just six points behind the Rossoneri at kick-off, Sassuolo had won both home editions of this fixture since their promotion to the top-flight in 2013.\n\nThey would soon make it three out of three. After taking the lead through a beautifully taken goal from Alfred Duncan in the 27th minute, Sassuolo never looked at risk of getting pegged back. Nicola Sansone made the score 2-0 under controversial circumstances late on, his team-mate Davide Biondini fortunate not to have been penalized for a foul on Andrea Bertolacci in the buildup, but Milan\u2019s legitimate complaints over that incident could not mask their own shortcomings in attack.\n\nBalotelli and Bacca never looked in sync as a partnership, the former failing to occupy wide spaces and deliver crosses as Niang might. If the lack of cohesion was understandable, given the two players\u2019 scant experience of playing together, then Balotelli\u2019s indifferent body language and failure to impose himself on his own terms were harder to justify. He did not touch the ball once in Sassuolo\u2019s penalty area, and was subbed off in the 55th minute.\n\nHis replacement, M\u00e9nez, did not fare much better. Mihajlovic claimed afterwards that neither player is yet at full fitness, but that argument is becoming harder to swallow. Almost two months have gone by since Balotelli made his first post-injury appearance, against Fiorentina. This was the first league match he had started since then, and also the first one Milan have lost.\n\nWe cannot blame his struggles on extra-curricular distractions. With the exception of one crude gesture made towards Napoli supporters who gathered outside Milan\u2019s hotel to abuse him last month, Balotelli\u2019s behaviour has been beyond reproach. He has kept his head down, stayed out of the gossip columns and adhered diligently to clauses Milan inserted into his contract governing conduct, social media use and even personal grooming.\n\nBut the cold truth is that he has achieved little on the pitch so far to convince Milan that this relationship was worth reviving. He has only 10 games left in which to do so, and is unlikely to play in all of those unless his performances sharpen up swiftly.\n\nBalotelli may feel frustrated by the timing of his hernia, which cost him momentum at a time when the picture was beginning to look a little more positive. He would not be the first lonely heart, though, to discover that the success or failure of any love affair can come down to a matter of timing.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 No change at the top, with Juventus maintaining their three-point lead over Napoli after both teams won. The Partenopei will be happy to have Gonzalo Higua\u00edn back among the goals after recent overblown reactions to the striker going four games without one. Nobody was more culpable on that front, of course, than Napoli\u2019s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who suggested that Higua\u00edn needed to lose a kilo and a half in order to get back to his early season form. Was there more to such a comment than a clumsy attempt to motivate a star player? Knowing De Laurentiis, you certainly would not bet against it. He has been at loggerheads with Higua\u00edn for some time over the player\u2019s refusal to extend a contract which runs to 2018, and there was a whiff here of the public criticisms he levelled against Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani before they were each sold to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluigi Buffon has not let in a Serie A goal for 836 minutes. Photograph: Giorgio Perottino/Reuters\n\n\u2022 Another clean sheet for Gigi Buffon, who has now gone 836 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, making his the third-longest such streak in the history of the Italian top flight. The only players left to overtake are Dino Zoff, who lasted 903 minutes in 1972-73, and Sebastiano Rossi, who went 929 minutes for Milan in 1993-94. It is no foregone conclusion that Buffon will catch them; next up for Juventus are Sassuolo, who have won three straight. The Old Lady wobbled for a spell against Atalanta on Sunday, and there was a period - before Mario Lemina put the game beyond doubt with this excellent goal - when even the victory was looking far from secure at 1-0.\n\n\u2022 Could Roma yet have a say in the title race? An eight point gap to leaders Juventus will not be easily bridged, but Luciano Spalletti\u2019s side have at least established themselves as the next challenger in line behind Napoli after blowing away Fiorentina on Friday. The Giallorossi have now won seven straight in the league and the pace of Mohamed Salah and Stephan El Shaarawy only looked more devastating this week with Diego Perotti pulling the strings in a No10 role.\n\n\u2022 The relegation scrap just got a whole lot tighter, with only one point separating Palermo and Frosinone after the Sicilians lost to Inter and the Canarini won at home to Udinese. Where Palermo are without a win in seven matches, Frosinone have won half of their last six.\n\n\u2022 Verona, though, might be finished after they were thrashed 3-0 at home to Sampdoria - who are finally putting some distance (or, at the least, some more teams) between themselves and the relegation zone.\n\nResults: Atalanta 0-2 Juventus, Bologna 0-0 Carpi, Frosinone 2-0 Udinese, Genoa 1-0 Empoli, Inter 3-1 Palermo, Napoli 3-1 Chievo, Roma 4-1 Fiorentina, Sassuolo 2-0 Milan, Torino 1-1 Lazio, Verona 0-3 Sampdoria"]], "2016-09-07": [[["Samuel Gibbs"], "00:00:00", "Nintendo will finally launch its iconic character Mario on smartphones starting with a running game for the iPhone called Super Mario Run.\n\nNintendo\u2019s Shigeru Miyamoto, father of Mario, took to the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco alongside Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook to announce the coming game.\n\nCook said: \u201cSince the launch of the App Store someone has been missing on the App Store, but I\u2019m glad to say, he\u2019s arrived now.\u201d\n\nMiyamoto said: \u201cThe magic of Mario is anyone can pick up and start playing, and now we\u2019ve made it even easier.\u201d\n\nSuper Mario Run is game in the vein of popular endless runners such as Subway Surfers and others.

The European Central Bank caught the financial markets totally unawares when it cut its key interest rate to 0.25% and there was an instant response. The euro - perilously overvalued on the foreign exchanges - fell like a stone.\n\nDraghi clearly had to overcome resistance from the ECB council, with some members seeking to delay any easing of policy to a later date. This would have been a mistake. The latest figures show the euro area flirting dangerously with deflation, with prices rising at an annual rate of just 0.7%. Try as he might to dispel the idea, the euro area today is starting to look worryingly like Japan in the early 1990s. Credit flows have dried up, a double dip recession has left oodles of spare capacity, and there is plenty of deflationary pressure coming down the pipeline, from the falling cost of food to lower prices for manufactured goods.\n\nDeflation is already a reality for the troubled countries on the fringes of monetary union, with the real and present danger of the core following before too long. So Draghi was quite right to face down the Bundesbank and insist on immediate action.\n\nThe fall in the value of the euro will - if sustained - help avert the threat of deflation by increasing the cost of imports. Draghi, therefore, missed a trick when he said the value of the single currency had not been discussed at the ECB's council meeting. This was the opportunity to talk down the euro, getting the maximum out of the cut in borrowing costs.\n\nThe ECB president also invited derision by saying that the eurozone (unemployment 12.2%, trend rate of growth 1% at best, a broken banking system) had the best economic fundamentals in the world. In truth, deflation threatens to trigger a new phase of the eurozone crisis, because falling prices plus weak growth equals unsustainable debt.

He may have been, as New York\u2019s liberal mayor Bill de Blasio said after Cuomo died, \u201ca man of unwavering principle\u201d. But no one ever said he did not know how to look after himself. The bachelor politician Ed Koch never forgave the posters in a New York mayoral primary campaign in 1977, proclaiming \u201cVote for Cuomo, Not the Homo\u201d, though Cuomo always denied responsibility. President Clinton was embarrassed to be recorded comparing the New York governor to a mafioso and calling him, for good measure, \u201ca mean son of a bitch\u201d. He himself called politics \u201can ugly business\u201d.\n\nMario\u2019s parents, Andrea and Immaculata, had come from the province of Salerno in the Italian Mezzogiorno to the Queens neighbourhood of South Jamaica.\n\nIt was, as their son said later, \u201cItalian-black-German-Irish-Polish\u201d, a working-class part of New York, and Cuomo was a \u201clunch-bucket Democrat\u201d, who never forgot the bread-and-butter issues that mattered to New York\u2019s working class.\n\nHe also never forgot the opportunities New York and America had given him.\n\nHe went to St John's preparatory school, a high school run by the nearby St John\u2019s University. There he was so good at baseball that he was put under contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who sent him to one of their farm clubs in Brunswick, Georgia. He was doing well there when he was hit on the head by a fast ball. He was blind for a week, and had to give up baseball: it was the best thing that could have happened.\n\nHe went to St John\u2019s, where he was first in his class, and then to its law school, where he was supported by his wife, Matilda (nee Raffa), a teacher, after their marriage in 1952. Four years later he was called to the New York bar and worked as a clerk to the head of the New York state court of appeal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Cuomo at the 1984 Democratic convention in Washington DC. Photograph: Rex\n\nIn 1958 he went to work for a Brooklyn law firm and had no involvement in politics until he was over 30, when he was successful in helping a group of local homeowners who were threatened with losing their land to the ambitions of the New York \u201cmaster builder\u201d, Robert Moses, for the New York World's Fair of 1964-65. Again in 1972, Cuomo successfully mediated a dispute about a housing project on behalf of New York mayor John Lindsay, and in 1974 he undertook his first campaign, for lieutenant governor. He was elected to that post on his second attempt, in 1978, helped by another St John\u2019s alumnus and Catholic politician, the Democratic governor, Hugh Carey.\n\nIt was not until 1982 that Cuomo ran successfully for governor of the state, and won again in 1986 and 1990. At first he was brilliantly successful, so much so that he was re-elected to his second term with 65% of the vote. In 1983 he settled a prison riot at Sing Sing, known at the time as the Ossining correctional facility \u2013 in contrast to the bloodbath at Attica prison, in which 29 prisoners and 10 hostages had died, under his predecessor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971 \u2013 and raised money for education through huge bond issues.\n\nLater, life became more difficult because, as he candidly admitted at the start of his third term in 1991: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money.\" The paradox was that, though his presidential career prospects suffered because of his loyalty to New York state, he always did enough to keep his national prospects alive because it helped his poll standing in New York.\n\nIn October 1991 he said he was thinking of running for president, but two months later, with a plane waiting at the airport in Albany to take him to New Hampshire to file for the key presidential primary election there, he decided not to go. Two years later he turned down President Clinton\u2019s offer of the place on the supreme court that went to another New York liberal, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and in 1994, to his and everyone\u2019s else\u2019s surprise, he was defeated for re-election by the relatively unknown Republican, George Pataki.\n\nIn the end, when asked by the New York Times what he would like to have said in his obituary he replied: \u201cI tried.\" They used to say that you couldn\u2019t be president of the United States if your surname ended in a vowel. But it was Barack Obama, not Mario Cuomo, who first proved that wrong. In truth he did not try hard enough to be president.\n\nHe is survived by Matilda, his daughters, Margaret, Maria and Madeline, and his sons, Christopher and Andrew.

They forecast falls of 0.1% when figures are released next Wednesday, with plunging oil prices a major factor.\n\nSpain and Greece are experiencing falling prices and some economists are warning that the 19-strong currency bloc could become mired in a deflationary spiral that further dampens spending and consumer confidence.\n\nOil prices fell to a five-year low on Friday, with benchmark Brent crude tumbling by 1.8% to $56.31 by the close in New York.\n\nAlthough Draghi said the risk of deflation in the eurozone was limited, he indicated the ECB was becoming more concerned. \u201cThe risk that we do not fulfil our mandate of price stability is higher than six months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in technical preparations to adjust the size, speed and compositions of our measures in early 2015, should it become necessary to react to a too-long period of low inflation. There is unanimity with the governing council on this.\u201d\n\nHe said government bond purchases were among the tools the ECB could use to fulfil its price-stability mandate.\n\nBuying government bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing, is seen as one of the last weapons in the ECB\u2019s arsenal to revive the eurozone, with interest rates having already been knocked down to 0.05%.\n\nHolger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said Draghi\u2019s words signalled that the ECB was likely to announce sovereign bond purchases on 22 January. \u201cIt is not about the actual size of the bond purchases; the key is whether they send a strong and credible signal to investors.\u201d\n\nBut he also challenged the view of some economists that lower prices were bad for the eurozone. \u201cDeflation is not much of a problem. We are grateful that oil prices are lower and that is a good thing for the real economy. The weak state of demand is the problem and the ECB ought do be doing something to stimulate confidence.\u201d\n\nDraghi\u2019s remarks came as data showed that Europe\u2019s manufacturing output was stagnant at the end of 2014. Eurozone factory output was on course for its worst performance since the recovery began in autumn 2013, according to the Markit survey of purchasing managers. The headline index rose to 50.6 in December, slightly up from November\u2019s low of 50.1, but still a lacklustre performance on an index where anything over 50 counts as expansion.\n\nIreland, Spain and the Netherlands performed better than average, but factory output in France, Italy, Greece and Austria fell as orders continued to decline. Germany saw a modest growth in factory output, but some economists remain worried about subdued growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing weakness of German manufacturing also remains a major source of concern, but there are signs that order-book growth could be turning around, with inflows of new work edging higher for the first time in four months,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the survey compiler Markit.\n\nIn the Handelsblatt interview, Draghi insisted there was no question of weaker countries being forced out of the eurozone. \u201cA breakup of the eurozone? That will not happen. That\u2019s why there is no plan B,\u201d he said. He also called on states to step up reform plans, by reducing tax and red tape.\n\nBut a senior ally of Angela Merkel warned the ECB against embarking on financial stimulus without economic reforms from the weaker countries of the eurozone.\n\nMichael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader of the German chancellor\u2019s Christian Democrats, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pump extra money into these states, but rather make sure they continue along the reform path.\u201d\n\nIn remarks reported by Reuters, he said there would be \u201cfierce discussion\u201d about the ECB\u2019s bond-buying plan at its next policy meeting, referring to well-known opposition to quantitative easing from the head of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann."]], "2016-05-26": [[["Andy Hunter"], "00:00:00", "Liverpool are considering a move for the Southampton forward Sadio Man\u00e9 after their hopes of luring Mario G\u00f6tze to Anfield were put on hold.\n\nDani Alves is a target for Juventus and an English club, reveals his agent Read more\n\nMan\u00e9 is expected to be a target for Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur this summer following another productive season at St Mary\u2019s Stadium.

It showed a man who, quite literally, could not believe his luck. It showed a man talking absolute gibberish. Yet, with his eyes barely visible, what with the breadth of the smile pushing his considerable cheeks upwards, his unmistakable turnip filling the 5:3 screen, his broad shoulders reduced to a shuddering giggle, it is impossible not to \u2018get that smile\u2019 and smile with him.\n\nIn looking and talking down the barrel of the camera, even raising a chubby finger through the fourth wall, you feel as though he is talking directly to you. And maybe this is his charm. Maybe it was this that seduced his wife Lynne, Sunderland\u2019s layabouts and the FA\u2019s layabouts suits into getting on board with him. Perhaps it is this that England\u2019s association football players will bleed, sweat and cry for.\n\nSam Allardyce: far too early to say if Wayne Rooney will remain England captain Read more\n\nThe Fiver is on board with Sam all right. It wouldn\u2019t have been a shock to see him, The People\u2019s Champ, one eyebrow raised and one elbow dangerously dangling below his shoulder, enter his first press conference as England manager on Monday and demand the waiting press pack take a whiff of his culinary output. But he didn\u2019t. After taking the weekend to calm down, Sam appeared only slightly more composed than on Friday, this time doing his utmost to keep a straight face. \u201cIt were 10 years since I was last interviewed and to sit here is a huge thrill for me. I think I fit the chair, I hope I do,\u201d Allardyce mused, his legendary buttocks now perched firmly on luxurious snakeskin upholstery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got the experience to challenge the England team and challenge myself. Managing five Premier League teams has given me huge experience.\u201d Asked whether Wayne Rooney would remain as captain, he sensibly answered: \u201cI\u2019m going to leave that until I meet all the players and get all the staff together,\u201d before conceding that his style is \u201cpragmatic.\u201d\n\nBut then the sensible mask of seriousness slipped. The corner of his mouth curled upwards and out came a laugh so hearty that international managers, some thousands of miles away, felt a sudden chill in the air. In a scene not dissimilar from England\u2019s unofficial Dizzee Rascal and James Corden World Cup song in 2010, Sam concluded with the line that every person in post-Brexit England wanted to hear: \u201cI\u2019m tough enough.

Steve has mostly been musing about the fate of Greece and the knock-on effect on the Eurozone, as well as what impact the endorsing of the yes vote by the former conservative leader Costas Karamanlis will have, but he has been wondering about other things too. What was his favourite incarnation of the Sugarbabes, would he look good with an ice-cream cone on his face like Gucci\u2019s and what is the best way to bring stability to Newcastle. In case you haven\u2019t noticed it, dear Mill readers, over the last few years, Newcastle have been more all over the place than a teenager\u2019s emotions. But sweat not, sweet fans of Newcastle, Steve is tapping the right side of his nose with his right index finger and is flashing his freshly pained grill. He knows how to solve this problem, he knows what needs to be done. He is going to bring in a superstar, the type of buy that will have the fans sleeping outside the club shop for days just to get his name printed on their jersey; the type of buy that will have those not sleeping outside the club shop, sleeping outside the local tattoo parlour to get his name emblazoned just above where they have the picture of their kids; the type of buy that will bring a professionalism to the side and make the rest of players up their game and work ten times harder.

She said you get them from being bitten by a dog. The next week, a woman on his block gave birth to triplets and he thought she\u2019d been bitten by a great dane. No, it has nothing to do with that at all and more to do with the call they have just got from Tottenham. The London lads were very polite and prim. They asked how Everton were doing and how the mother was and whether she had recovered from her fall and they did not forget to mention that they had enjoyed the sister\u2019s ballet recital immensely. With the pleasantries out of the way, they soon got down to business. We\u2019re interested in James McCarthy, they said. At this point, Everton knew this call was going nowhere but decided to reciprocate the politeness afforded to them and so they let Spurs natter on. We\u2019re interested in James McCarthy, they repeated, and we are willing to offer you Aaron Lennon or Younes Kaboul in return.

Unlike its peers, CARS gives you access to all its cars and tracks straight away, letting race wins stand on the satisfaction of driving well rather than the hackneyed industry standard of drip-feeding new content. Sadly, though, technical difficulties abound, from your car failing to respond to controls to races where there are no sound effects.

That was of course substantial and had a big impact on the personal plans of many young people. But the magnitude was not so different from the losses suffered by other generations, although of course the young do not have the same assets and savings to fall back on in tough economic times. Even more worrying was the sharp increase in youth unemployment in Europe.\n\nEuropean job market is rigged against younger workers, says Draghi Read more\n\nAre you worried about the position of young adults in Europe and is this an increasingly urgent issue?\n\nYouth unemployment is a tragedy and prevents people from playing a full and meaningful part in society. If every second young person is out of work \u2013 as is still the case in some countries in Europe \u2013 it seriously harms the economy, because people willing to work cannot work and skills are not developed. And it threatens social harmony. Unemployment can lead in the long run to increased social problems and ill health.\n\nAre you worried about future consumption levels of young adults, as this group \u2013 who have been especially \u201cscarred\u201d by the global recession \u2013 move into middle age?\n\nConsumption within a society is determined partly by wealth distribution, but even more important is that the young generation can participate in the labour market in a fair way. In many countries the labour market is set up to protect older \u201cinsiders\u201d \u2013 people with permanent, high-paid contracts and shielded by strong labour laws. The side-effect is that young people are stuck with lower-paid, temporary contracts and get fired first in crisis times. That also means that employers are reluctant to invest in young people, so the incomes of this generation stay lower over their lifetime.\n\nWhat might be the forces at work here \u2013 demographics, changing workplaces, fiscal and monetary policy \u2013 that mean young adults appear to be receiving little of the rewards from two-and-a-half decades of average economic growth?\n\nNobody stays young forever. The crucial question is whether a person can participate fully in the economy over his or her lifetime \u2013 get a good education, find a job, buy a home for the family. Income and wealth follow. What makes me worry is that increasing inequality might prevent people from doing that. This is an issue all our societies need to look at carefully. The ECB\u2019s role in that is to maintain price stability, which prevents unfair redistribution. For example, our research shows that in the euro area too low inflation results in redistribution from younger, more indebted households to older households that are typically net creditors.\n\nWhat matters is that young people, as they move through life, have the opportunities to build up wealth, too\n\nCurrent retirees are wealthier than ever. What opportunities does this bring to Europe?\n\nIn an ageing society, the fact that retirees are getting wealthier isn\u2019t necessarily abnormal \u2013 older people need to accumulate more wealth to finance living longer. As they spend their wealth during retirement, it passes back to the younger generations. So wealth creation isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. What matters is that young people, as they move through life, have the opportunities to build up wealth, too.\n\nDo you think younger adults today will have as good a standard of living as pensioners today when they retire?\n\nThat\u2019s our common choice. Our standard of living depends on the strength of our economy. We need a more open, flexible, innovative and business-friendly society. Much focus is put on the central bank to raise growth, and it can contribute through price stability and a stable financial system. But in the long run real growth is driven by what the economy can produce. That is much more about ideas, technology, flexibility, motivation, skills. It is up to elected governments to set a growth-friendly environment.\n\nYou often talk about the need for structural reform in employment. What do you mean by this?\n\nThere are lots of forms this can take. Just to give one example, the kurzarbeit scheme in Germany allowed employers to adjust working time during the crisis without firing people. But there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all model. Every society has its challenges and preferences. The idea generally is to create a fair and flexible labour market where companies do not fear taking on staff when they need them and specific groups of people are not structurally disadvantaged at times when employers need to cut wage bills.\n\nWhat can central banks and governments do to ease or resolve these issues?\n\nEveryone has a vital interest in a prospering economy. So bringing down high levels of youth unemployment is a priority for everyone. As I said, the best contribution central banks can make here is to live up to their mandates. We can only encourage elected governments to take the necessary steps to create jobs and make their societies fairer. Over the longer term, by far the most important thing for young people is investing in education and skills. Skills are a person\u2019s passport through life, and in a fast-changing digital economy, the premium paid for skills is only likely to rise.

This concerned, for example, the handling of Brexit, as well as conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates more generally.\u201d\n\nDombret played down the impact of Brexit on the financial system. \u201cBrexit and its possible repercussions for the City of London are unlikely to be an issue for financial stability or the financing of the EU\u2019s real economy,\u201d he said.\n\nFrance\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, told the conference that Paris was ready to welcome banking business, as Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, warned that banks were getting ready to move. \u201cTheir hands are poised quivering over the relocate button, with the first movements expected in the coming months,\u201d Browne said.\n\nMay has said she intends to trigger article 50 \u2013 the formal mechanism that starts the two-year negotiating period to leave the EU \u2013 in March.

We trust ourselves to be competitive against the best and we are not scared to play with width no matter who we are facing.\n\n\u201cMario has brought a change of mindset to Australia\u2019s scrum. Instead of being a platform to get the ball in play for them, they now look for psychological domination, which they got over England. They have attacked most teams and I like that because it means the scrum will be a proper contest, two teams wanting to test themselves there. As a front row, that is the opponent you want to face, someone who will contest the scrum rather than looking to neutralise you and get away with things.\u201d\n\nArgentina are hoping their captain and hooker, Agust\u00edn Creevy, will recover from a leg injury he sustained against Ireland. They announce their team on Friday evening with all the other players who started against Ireland expected to be fit.\n\n\u201cAgust\u00edn is key to us because he is our captain and plays at hooker, but we have a number of leaders in the squad,\u201d said the scrum coach, Emiliano Bergamaschi. \u201cThe scrum is going to be an important part of the game against Australia because of the influence Mario has had with them. I have noticed a change in body positions and the way they now scrummage as a whole pack.\n\n\u201cWe have changed our style of play, but the scrum remains important to us. We feel every scrum, we want to play every scrum, contesting it and putting the opposition under pressure. They are more dangerous there because of what Mario has done and they are certainly better prepared there mentally now.\u201d\n\nIt will be Argentina\u2019s second appearance in a semi-final after their breakthrough tournament in 2007, equalling Wales\u2019s tally and taking them one ahead of Scotland and two of Ireland. \u201cWe are not getting carried away,\u201d said Ayerza, who was in the Pumas\u2019 squad eight years ago. \u201cWe know we are still improving as a side and that we still have some way to go.\n\n\u201cBut we know what we are capable of when we are on our best form and when our mindset is right. This is a World Cup semi-final and if anyone is not ready or hungry to play, they are in the wrong sport.

They also made it more expensive for banks to park money with the ECB \u2013 cutting the deposit rate, which was already negative, from -0.1% to -0.2% in the hope of persuading banks to lend more to businesses and consumers.\n\nThe action took investors by surprise and drove the euro down more than two cents against the dollar to a 14-month low of $1.29. A weaker currency helps the eurozone's exporters.\n\nIn London the Bank of England held rates at a record low of 0.5% for the 66th monthly meeting in a row.\n\nEuropean stock markets rose following the decisive action from the ECB president, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues on the governing council. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies across the region, rose 1.2% to its highest close since January 2008.\n\n\"The ECB stepped up to the plate as the eurozone recovery is grinding almost to a halt,\" said Christian Schulz, a senior economist at the German bank Berenberg.\n\nThe central bank announced further measures to encourage lending by buying asset-backed securities. Full details will be published in October, Draghi said.\n\nThe ECB stopped short of embarking on full-scale quantitative easing (QE) which would potentially involve the bank purchasing government debt.\n\nDraghi revealed the 24-strong governing council was split over the package of new measures, but said a \"comfortable majority\" was in favour. It is thought that Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, was opposed.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference following the decision, he said the eurozone's member states were also divided over QE.\n\n\"QE was discussed. Some members of the governing council were in favour of doing more, and some members were in favour of doing less. So our proposals strike the mid road.\" Draghi said interest rates would not be cut further.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said: \"With another rate cut, an ABS purchasing programme and a new covered bond purchasing programme, the ECB has now reached a point at which fully fledged QE, ie outright purchases of government bonds, is the only option left.\"\n\nThe ECB nudged down its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 0.9%, from an earlier forecast of 1%. It also revised down its growth forecasts for 2015 to 1.6%, from 1.7%, but it revised up its forecast for 2016 to 1.9%, from 1.8%.\n\nIt lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 0.6% from a previous forecast of 0.7%, but Draghi said policymakers did not expect outright deflation, despite a current inflation rate of just 0.3%.\n\nThe ECB left its inflation forecast for 2015 and 2016 unchanged at 1.1% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nThere was zero growth in the eurozone economy in the second quarter, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Fears are mounting that rising tensions between the west and Russia, fuelled by the alleged presence of Russian troops in Ukraine, will derail the weak recovery."], [["Larry Elliott", "Nouriel Roubini"], "00:00:00", "Mario Draghi chose his moment well. The financial markets were expecting the meeting of the governing council of the European Central Bank to be a non-event. As it happened, it was anything but the expected big yawn.\n\nThe first surprise was that the ECB again cut interest rates, despite Draghi having said earlier in the summer that they were already at rock bottom levels. The second shocker was the announcement that the bank would start to purchase asset-backed securities as a way of getting money into the banking system.\n\nThe reason for the action is simple: growth in the eurozone looks a lot weaker than it did earlier in the year. A fresh recession could drive the single currency zone into outright deflation, so the ECB is doing its level best to import some inflation by driving down the value of the euro. By picking a moment when the dollar was already riding high on the foreign exchanges, Draghi managed to push the single currency down by two cents yesterday.\n\nThe plan, clearly, is to get ahead of the curve and so avoid the need for full-blown quantitative easing (QE), something Germany and its allies oppose. But if buying asset-backed securities doesn't work, QE will be the one remaining shot in the locker.\n\nIn truth, it all looks too little, too late. European banks do not seem to be short of cash; rather, it is that they are unwilling to lend and that animal spirits among businesses are so low. Keynes, who called this pushing on a piece of string, would be advocating cuts in taxes or higher public spending as a way of generating growth.\n\nThat is, indeed, the way forward. Germany could avoid the need for QE by running down its budget surplus, thus boosting consumption and helping other eurozone countries. If the ECB does deploy QE, it should bypass banks more inclined to hoard than lend. Any new money should go directly to consumers or be used for capital investment projects."]], "2016-01-21": [[["Katie Allen"], "00:00:00", "The European Central Bank brought respite to volatile financial markets after indicating it is ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone as soon as March.\n\n\n\nThe ECB left interest rates on hold at its latest policy meeting but its president, Mario Draghi, acknowledged growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as he said the central bank would review its policy in March \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting.\n\n\n\nLondon\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart, Mark Carney, this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened.\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn.\n\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2%.

Perhaps you can easily name some from your reading. Today, YA books are starting to include people of all shapes and sizes as the heroes of their own books. However, when I was growing up, most of the books I read didn\u2019t have women as main characters.\n\nAnd then one day I came across Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy, starring Lyra Belacqua. Suddenly, I realised how few heroines I had come across in my reading. Happily, Lyra was the perfect introduction: a forceful, quick-witted, deceitful, proud heroine at the centre of her own story.\n\n\n\nI was completely enchanted by Lyra. In the first book, Northern Lights, someone says \u201cyou cannot change what you are, only what you do.\u201d Throughout the trilogy, Lyra never apologises for being a girl, refusing to let her gender define her. While Lyra does face down people \u2013 and bears \u2013 who think that being a girl somehow makes her weaker, she never believes them. Instead, Lyra proves them wrong and goes on fantastic adventures into other worlds.\n\nHow do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?

You definitely need friends, and sometimes a cute boy or girl. Lyra trusts and needs her friends, especially her daemon companion Pantalaimon. Pan, as he is also known, is one of the most charming side-kicks in literature, changing from a mouse to a pine marten to a dragon, depending on his mood! And then there is Will, a boy from another world who falls in love with Lyra. And while I won\u2019t tell you what happens, there is a beautiful love story in the second and third books.\n\nHowever, Pullman never stops writing fantasy adventure. Just because Lyra is a girl doesn\u2019t mean that romance is the most important thing in her life, or that love makes her weak. Instead, love becomes strength for Lyra, and she can depend on Will to help her in her adventures saving multiple universes.\n\n\n\nIn The Amber Spyglass, the last book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, Pullman wrote a line that I always read when I need inspiration: \u201cTell them stories. They need the truth. You must tell them true stories, and everything will be well, just tell them stories.\u201d\n\nLyra\u2019s story, even if it is set in an Oxford that is not really our Oxford, is still true. Truth is how real Lyra seems when you are reading her story. Truth is how you feel when reading the books. Truth is that girls are heroines, and need their stories just as much as boys.

Still less that, over 30 years later, he would be able to let any old gamer emulate his development process (albeit with vastly superior tools than the ones he had in 1985), while melding the most venerable gameplay with a truly 21st-century gaming phenomenon. But that\u2019s what Super Mario Maker does: by giving gamers the means to create their own Super Mario courses, it enters the realms of user-generated content alongside the stunningly successful likes of Minecraft and LittleBigPlanet.\n\nSuper Mario Maker gently eases you into your quest to become the new Miyamoto, with a half-built course that you must jazz up simply by painting new elements on the screen of the Wii U\u2019s Gamepad, using the stylus. You can add various blocks, either vanilla or containing power-ups and rewards, enemies such as goombas, trampolines, pipes and so on. Then, using the so-called Coursebot, you can name your creation (the game carefully explains that an interesting name can attract a much bigger audience) and publish it for all to play. Although, sensibly, you aren\u2019t allowed to publish it until you\u2019ve completed a play-through \u2013 it\u2019s dead easy to make courses that are physically impossible to negotiate.\n\nAt first, there\u2019s plenty of potential for embarrassment, when you realise that perhaps your level-design skills aren\u2019t quite yet on a par with those of Miyamoto, and what you\u2019ve posted for others to play is not going to change the face of gaming at a stroke. But Coursebot, mercifully, lets you delete your juvenilia, and as you persist, you will undergo a number of small realisations about what constitutes a good side-scrolling 2D platform level.\n\nYou will, however, have to demonstrate a certain amount of persistence when you start playing Super Mario Maker. That\u2019s because, rather than giving you the full palette of course-design elements right away, it starts you off with a very limited set, then drip-feeds a daily selection of new ones, after monitoring how much time you\u2019ve spent playing the game. This is somewhat frustrating: a walk-before-you-can-run approach is all well and good but, from the off, you can download vast amounts of courses that others have created, full of exotic elements like doors, Boos, lava and platforms that move along carefully delineated paths, but you can\u2019t properly edit those levels until you\u2019ve played Super Mario Maker long enough to have acquired those elements.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest After three decades of Mario games, Nintendo is inviting players to create their own levels in the bouncy plumber\u2019s homeland. Photograph: AP\n\nStill, that approach does at least focus you on the basics of designing Super Mario levels, which can only be a good thing. And cute touches abound. You can re-skin your mini-masterpieces at the touch of an icon \u2013 initially, you\u2019re given the classic Super Mario Bros art-style, along with that of New Super Mario Bros U, but there are countless others to acquire, taking you through some of the more obscure historical iterations of the game. Every art style has an underground variation, so you can instantly make sub-levels, accessible via pipes. Underwater and boss levels are possible, and hooking up amiibos gives you exotic, non-standard Mario power-ups. The fact that, unlike Miyamoto himself, Super Mario Maker owners are free from the tyranny of having to make coherent, structured games means that there\u2019s already an awful lot of wild and inventive experimentation on show. Although you are still encouraged to make whole worlds, consisting of groups of four levels.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve played Super Mario Maker enough to unlock everything (a process that takes the best part of a week), something of a step-change occurs, and you can get busy busting the Mario conventions that have stood for three decades. But if your skills do prove a tad deficient, Super Mario Maker still has plenty to offer. Course World is a giant repository of user-generated levels, and you can opt to take the 100 Mario Challenge, which picks sets of eight courses and gives you 100 lives with which to reach the end \u2013 not as generous as it may sound, since difficulty levels tend towards the fearsome. A 10 Mario Challenge offers a similar experience, but with tightly selected levels that showcase some of the more outlandish forms of gameplay that Super Mario Maker supports, and are designed to get your creative juices running. Plus you can dive into any random level in Course World that sounds appealing, or sample anything made by particular individuals who have impressed you.\n\nOnce you overcome the initial frustration engendered by Super Mario Maker\u2019s refusal to give you all its tools at once, it provides a wondrously moreish experience that will enthral a generation of tinkerers.

But it is surely destined to become known as a cult-classic, and it will be interesting to see if it fuels a spike in Wii U sales."]], "2015-01-11": [[["Heather Stewart"], "00:00:00", "Prices are tumbling, right across the eurozone. But for consumers from Amsterdam to Athens, this is not a bumper Christmas sell-off: the falling cost of their weekly shop reflects a deep economic malaise.\n\nAfter Brussels statisticians announced last week that inflation had been negative in December, with prices falling at an annual rate of 0.2%, experts warned that without drastic action the eurozone may be sliding towards a Japanese-style deflationary slump.\n\n\u201cThis move in December is significant,\u201d said Janet Henry, European economist at HSBC, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the first time that inflation has been negative since 2009 \u2013 in the depths of the crisis \u2013 and it\u2019s going to turn further negative in the next few months.\u201d\n\nNews that the long-predicted onset of deflation had arrived \u2013 aided by the recent sharp drop in oil prices \u2013 will intensify the pressure on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to press on with quantitative easing \u2013 one of the few tactics available to central bankers hoping to reflate the economy when interest rates are already on the floor. But some experts have little confidence that even a large-scale intervention will do much good.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve left it a bit too late to do anything about this,\u201d says Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. \u201cWhat took them so long? This has been building, and getting more and more embedded in people\u2019s expectations.\u201d\n\nEconomists don\u2019t generally worry too much about short periods of deflation, particularly if they are caused by external factors \u2013such as the plunging oil price. Cheaper energy boosts demand by putting more money in the pockets of consumers in oil-importing countries.\n\nBut there have long been concerns that in the eurozone, where growth is weak and a number of countries remain in recession, falling prices could become widespread and entrenched \u2013 and that\u2019s what really worries euro-watchers. Some countries, including bailed-out Greece and Portugal, have been living with falling prices \u2013 and wages \u2013 for some time. With exchange rates between member countries of the single currency fixed, this process of \u201cinternal devaluation\u201d was seen by many as a painful but necessary way for struggling countries to restore their competitiveness against more productive rivals such as Germany.\n\nYet even in Germany, which narrowly avoided recession in 2014, inflation is running at just 0.2%. The ECB\u2019s official mandate is to keep inflation across the eurozone \u201cclose to 2%\u201d.\n\nConsumers who believe that prices are going to continue falling tend to sit on their hands, postponing spending in the belief that their money will go further in the future. This weak demand can cause businesses to cut back on investment and stint on wages and a vicious spiral sets in. This is particularly dangerous for heavily indebted countries, as deflation increases the real value of their debts.\n\nIn Japan, policymakers have spent more than two decades trying to jolt the economy out of just this kind of deflationary trap: the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has rocketed to well over 200%.\n\nHSBC\u2019s Henry warns that some in the eurozone are already responding to the uncertain climate and the prospect of declining prices. \u201cFor companies in particular, there\u2019s already evidence of deflationary behaviour. Why are they going to invest if they think things are going to be even cheaper tomorrow?\u201d\n\nPeter Praet, the ECB\u2019s chief economist, said in an interview last month: \u201cWhat we are increasingly worried about \u2026 is the high risk that after seven years of crisis and poor economic performance in the euro area, businesses and households are reducing their long-term growth expectations and adapting to weak growth and low inflation. To some extent this risk is already materialising: companies are starting to adjust to a 1% growth/1% inflation economy.\u201d\n\nBehavioural changes like these are notoriously hard to forecast: the impact on workers\u2019 pay of their employers\u2019 chastened mood will depend partly on the specifics of wage-bargaining, for example. But if the onset of deflation adds to the downbeat mood, it may take a long time to shift.\n\nAs Praet put it: \u201cBefore the crisis we probably had excessively high growth expectations. Now it is the opposite. The big risk is that this growth pessimism perpetuates the current situation.\u201d\n\nDanny Gabay of Fathom Consulting, warns that in some ways, the situation in the eurozone is worse than Japan\u2019s at the start of what used to be known as its \u201clost decade\u201d \u2013 before the 10-year stretch became 20 years and more.\n\n\u201cJapan didn\u2019t fall into deflation with debts of 100% of GDP, unemployment in double digits and recession,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started from a pretty good point compared with Europe.\u201d Average unemployment across the eurozone is 11.5%, more than twice Japan\u2019s historical maximum.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s governing council will meet in Frankfurt on 22 January to decide whether to press ahead with quantitative easing. It has already been purchasing corporate bonds but full-blown QE \u2013 as undertaken in the US, UK and Japan in recent years \u2013 involves buying large volumes of sovereign bonds.\n\nHowever, unlike in those countries, it is unclear whether the ECB has the powers to embark on this controversial policy. On Wednesday, the European court of justice (ECJ) is due to issue a preliminary opinion on whether large-scale buying of crisis-hit countries\u2019 bonds, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), is allowed under European law.\n\nIn relatively calm times, when the trigger on OMT looks unlikely to be pulled, that sounds like an academic legal niggle. Yet if the court delivers an adverse opinion, Draghi\u2019s hands could be tied. OMT is a firefighting measure, devised to fulfil his promise in July 2012, when many investors were betting on a euro breakup, to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d to safeguard the single currency.\n\nIf the ECJ echoes the reservations of Germany\u2019s constitutional court about direct buying of member countries\u2019 bonds, the argument would apply equally to purchases of sovereign bonds under any large-scale QE programme.\n\nThe German court suggested that bond-buying was beyond the ECB\u2019s mandate \u2013 it impinges on economic policy, which is the remit of governments, and could amount to a back-door bailout \u2013 and asked the ECJ to examine the issue. Any sign that the court echoes these concerns would strengthen the hand of sceptics, including Germany\u2019s Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, who has repeatedly argued against QE and claimed last month that there was \u201ca whole row of economic reasons\u201d against the policy.\n\nSome analysts say the ECB could sidestep the constitutional difficulties, and placate QE\u2019s critics, by leaving individual central banks responsible for any eventual losses on the bonds the ECB buys; but that might dampen the impact of the policy, by encouraging investors to target more vulnerable member states if the risk of default appears to be rising. Much of the evidence on the effects of QE suggests it is most effective if central banks do it on a large scale.\n\nAnd while QE could buy the eurozone time, driving down long-term interest rates and giving exporters a boost by weakening the currency, it wouldn\u2019t solve the longer-term challenges of restoring growth and helping the banking sector work off the legacy of the credit crunch. \u201cI don\u2019t think QE\u2019s a panacea,\u201d says Jones at Llewellyn Consulting.\n\nSome experts now believe the eurozone will not be able to avoid a long period of lacklustre growth and high unemployment, which in turn is likely to fuel demands for an alternative to the doctrine of austerity. A recent report from Lombard Street Research said: \u201cThe main threat to the euro now comes from stubbornly high unemployment and the resulting appeal of populist politics. In fact, in a relatively short period of time new parties in Italy (the Five Star Movement and a transformed Lega Nord), Spain (Podemos), Greece (Syriza) and Germany (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland) have emerged to challenge the mainstream incumbents.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s a general election is set for 25 January, just a few days after the ECB\u2019s meeting. The radical Syriza party, which wants to write off some of the country\u2019s hefty debt burden and repudiate many of the onerous conditions of its bailout, is expected to win the popular vote. Its charismatic leader, Alexis Tsipras, is promising not just to extricate Greece from the clutches of its creditors, but to set the entire eurozone on a new path. He described his party in a recent article for the Huffington Post as \u201cthe alarm clock which will lift Europe from its lethargy and sleepwalking\u201d.\n\nBut it may take more than that to really jolt Europe\u2019s firms and consumers out of their deflationary funk."]], "2015-04-03": [[["Nadja Sayej"], "00:00:00", "Inside Kulturforum Berlin, for once the Peruvian photographer Mario Testino is in front of the camera rather than behind it. Faced with a scrum of photographers, he calmly directs the photo shoot. \u201cOK\u201d, says Testino, raising his arms at the press conference of his In Your Face exhibition this winter, \u201cI\u2019m going to start left and go right.\u201d\n\nStanding in a navy blue suit and polished, pointed shoes, he holds a tight smile, while moving his head slowly for every photographer. Not every subject is that thoughtful or considerate but it\u2019s not all pleasantries. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say how good I look?\u201d asks Testino, as if the clicks and flashes of cameras weren\u2019t enough.\n\nThe London-based photographer is no stranger to being in the cramped photo scrum. Known as the king of female glamour \u2013 he was one of the first to shoot Kate Moss and famously photographed Diana, Princess of Wales \u2013 Testino is now turning his lens to the men. This week he released his latest photography book Sir, a collection that explores masculinity, and working on it was a relief for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier,\u201d Testino says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do hair, makeup, clothes, the length of the skirt, the height of the heel \u2013 on a man, you can put anything and \u2018Oh! It looks great!\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josh Harnett. Photograph: Mario Testino/Taschen\n\nOver 300 photos from the past 30 years are featured in the limited-edition book. Sir features celebrities such as Brad Pitt and George Clooney, as well as David Bowie, who Testino looked up to as a teenager. Costume, gender play and travel shots are featured in a glossy and bombastic ride through Rio, Seville and London. But the collection goes beyond the fashion portrait to include dandy gentlemen, macho men, drag queens, jocks and civil servants in full uniform stomping down the streets.\n\n\u201cI was always better at men,\u201d said Testino, \u201cbut I realised the business was with women. So, I put all my energy on doing photographs with women and managed to do it well and learn it well, but at the same time, I was photographing men all through my career and many things haven\u2019t been seen.\u201d\n\nA fashion photographer for 30 years, Testino is a world-class portrait artist. His biggest break came in 1997 when Diana picked him to shoot her for the cover of Vanity Fair. Since then he has shot the British royal family, including Prince William and Catherine Middleton\u2019s engagement. As a photographer for fashion glossies Testino has shot a wide cast of superstars, including Rihanna, Kate Winslet and most recently, a ripped Justin Bieber for Vogue.\n\nTestino, 60, grew up in Peru, spent all his holidays in Brazil and attended an American school before moving to London as a 21-year-old. He lived in a boarding house that had be converted from a hospital, which cost him \u00a310 a week. \u201cI tell you, to get that \u00a310 a week was difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cTo take great pictures took me a long time.\u201d\n\nHe kicked off his career by taking out a bank loan, which took him 15 years to repay. But then things took off and Testino opened a nonprofit museum called Mate, which is a permanent exhibition of his artwork in Lima. He became a Save the Children ambassador to help raise funds to build the El Salvador Clinic in Peru. The hospital was funded by the sale of a single print of Diana, which auctioned for $150,000.\n\nHe\u2019s seen a lot of change during his career, particularly when it comes to male fashion and ideas of beauty. In Sir, Jay Z wears a Prince of Wales checked suit alongside photos of Yves Saint Laurent and Andy Warhol. The photos aren\u2019t laden with diamonds or even couture, but somehow remain almost as decorative as male peacocks.\n\n\u201cAlong with the fact that immense attention to fashion has changed, men today do everything. They wax themselves, they do their hair, pluck their eyebrows, they pluck their ears, they wear perfume. It has changed,\u201d Testino said.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the right time to do a book just dedicated to my own.\u201d\n\nHe gets people to relax by being silly and informal, inviting them to step boldly into the unknown. Some of the photos are incredibly feminine, like Josh Hartnett putting on lipstick, which Testino felt strengthened his masculinity. \u201cI suggested it and he said right away, \u2018yes, but go the whole way,\u2019 so we did the eyes too,\u201d he recalls in an interview with opera director Patrick Kinmonth in the book\u2019s foreword.\n\nThere is a photo of Ashton Kutcher lying in a hospital bed and a brotherly shot of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. \u201cI have always tried to give the sensation that you are getting special proximity to the subjects in my pictures, that you are getting to know what it is like to be right there with this amazing person,\u201d Testino writes in the book, \u201calone with them\u201d.\n\nThe earliest portraits in the book draw from the 80s, when Testino first got into photography. A 1988 portrait shows Erick J\u00fcssen, a Los Angeles locations expert, who would later find Testino\u2019s Hollywood Hills home. Some of the more recent works include Japanese yoga teacher Yuya Sarashina wrapped up as a human pretzel and a photo of Japan\u2019s most controversial photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, whose courage inspires Testino.\n\nHis fascination with lavish costume and theatrics hails back to Peruvian folk culture, like the colourful, patterned ponchos men wear in the countryside, as he photographed one man in the mountains of Cusco.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Testino on the front row with Astrid Berges Frisbey. Photograph: Michel Dufour/WireImage\n\nSelf-image and perfection bubble up throughout the book, especially since the maddening struggle for flawlessness is difficult for all of us. Even behind the lens, Testino has had his own doubts alongside the beefcakes he\u2019s shot over the years (he still won\u2019t admit if he is gay, straight or bisexual). In an interview, Testino jokes as to why any of his fans would want to be photographed with him, claiming \u201cI find myself very unattractive compared to other people.\u201d\n\nWhile many photos are typically retouched into the fountain of Photoshop youth, Testino only fixes \u201cdistractions\u201d, that being the furniture as much as someone\u2019s wrinkles.\n\nRenowned for his fashion shoots, he\u2019s done his fair share of paparazzi. His access to VIP parties show a more personal side of polished personalities \u2013 including Orlando Bloom kissing David Beckham on the cheek. It\u2019s a key photo to Testino, who admires Beckham for his unapologetic fearlessness, tattoos and his global influence on men\u2019s style.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all celebrities, but Testino has become a celebrity himself as a byproduct of shooting the stars. A relentless self-promoter, Testino has hired a video crew to follow him around press conferences, documenting his life.\n\n\u201cWhen nobody wants you, you\u2019ve got to pretend that they want you,\u201d he says.

Well, in the 2004-05 season they finished fourth, a mere 34 points behind the title winners Chelsea and Moyes seems to think that if a team packed with gilded superstars such as Tony Hibbert, Tim Cahill, Lee Carsley and James McFadden had only had a more prolific centre-forward than Duncan Ferguson, then they might have been able to bridge that gap.

Reading these essays and articles on what Vargas Llosa sees as the dying gasps of our culture \u2013 poisoned by generalised tabloid frivolity when it isn\u2019t being gashed by extreme (religious) seriousness \u2013 I was occasionally reminded of Camacho\u2019s dark energy, and at other times of TS Eliot\u2019s or Matthew Arnold\u2019s high moral ground when confronted by the depredations of mass taste.\n\nVargas Llosa has long been known as a public intellectual as well as a novelist in the Spanish-speaking world \u2013 and indeed in the UK, where he lived in the 1980s. One-time contender for his country\u2019s presidency, a cultural liberal who wants value in the arts, ideas and literature to rule over easy relativism, the register of price and the \u201ccivilisation of spectacle\u201d, he worries over the dangers to democracy the latter group poses. He\u2019s at home with the giants of French theory, from Guy Debord, inventor of situationism, to Jacques Derrida and his archival fever. Their impact, he notes, has hardly been salutary. Meanwhile, neither artists nor critics, journalists nor politicians value judgment or intelligence.\n\nBy succumbing to what Marshall McLuhan called an \u201cimage bath\u201d, he writes, the 21st-century west has ushered in a time of \u201cdocile submission to emotions and sensations triggered by an unusual and at times very brilliant bombardment of images that capture our attention, though they dull our sensibilities and intelligence due to their primary and transitory nature\u201d. A shallow levity has taken over. The ethics of Hello!, which he reminds us was originally a Spanish magazine, rule. Entertainment is all. Translated into the political sphere, this means our politicians increasingly become clowns, prepared to do anything to capture media attention. The press, whose freedom is crucial, is more symptom than outright cause of this regrettable phenomenon.\n\nIn one of the best essays in the book, Culture, Politics and Power, Vargas Llosa explores the decline of our political sphere. Sullied and sometimes exposed by tabloid journalism, politics is estimated to be a \u201cmediocre and grubby activity that puts off the most honest and capable people and instead mainly recruits nonentities and rogues\u2026\u201d The best, as a result, are no longer attracted to it \u2013 not even in the UK, which Vargas Llosa thinks has a long tradition of high civic duty. He cites the hacking saga as an example of the scandalous conduct of the press and complicity of power-seeking politicians, though he doubts that the evil \u2013 \u201cthe playful banality of the dominant culture\u201d \u2013 will be rooted out by the closure of the News of the World. The rot is in ourselves and in our desire to be amused by the spectacle of \u201ccatching a minister or parliamentarian with his trousers down\u201d.\n\nIs there an antidote to all this in the values that stem from religion? Do the people need their opium \u2013 not only the solace of an afterlife, but the illusion of a higher authority to impose a sense of moral value? Vargas Llosa seems to be convinced of the case, though he simultaneously recognises the nullifying dictatorships that religious states continue to impose and is adamant about the necessity of a secular state and public sphere. He is also a great advocate of the erotic life \u2013 with the necessary obstacles, of course, without which there can be no pleasure.\n\nPedro Camacho, as well as his higher-brow double, are both alive and well in this ever-provocative collection.\n\nLisa Appignanesi\u2019s Trials of Passion (Virago) will be out in paperback this winter.

During the pool stages Ledesma, who represented Argentina with passion and distinction on 84 occasions during his playing career, admitted that he was \u201cpraying every day\u201d that the Wallabies and Los Pumas\u2019 paths would not cross. Yet on Sunday they will tear into each other for a place in the World Cup final.\n\nIt has led to speculation that Ledesma is wrestling with split loyalties, with the head pulling one way and the heart tumbling the other. The Wallabies\u2019 hooker James Hanson scoffs at the suggestion. \u201cHe\u2019s 100% in as regards to the ride,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cHe wants to win at least as much as anyone else in this team \u2013 and he\u2019s made that pretty clear to us.\u201d\n\nRather than bare his soul to the world\u2019s media, Ledesma, who has served as Australia\u2019s forwards coach since the start of the year, has been squirrelled away on the training pitch, devising a strategy to jolt Argentina\u2019s forward momentum.\n\nAustralia will not underestimate \u2018dangerous\u2019 Argentina, says Matt Giteau Read more\n\nAnd Hanson, who has been working closely with Ledesma to emulate the Pumas\u2019 scrum during vigorous training sessions, believes his inside knowledge could be crucial. \u201cWhen the reserves run as Argentina we have Mario on our team to run our plays,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cHe has given us a really good insight into our opponents\u2019 psyche.\u201d\n\nThere is clearly much affection for Ledesma in the Wallaby camp. Faces light up when his name is mentioned and players\u2019 words are always warm. As Hanson puts it: \u201cMario\u2019s been great. He\u2019s got a lot of charisma and he\u2019s always willing to help. There has been complete buy into what he does but we are also able to take the mickey out of his accent and he rolls with it, and loves it. We feel like a family now. That we\u2019re all brothers.\u201d\n\nThere is more reticence when it comes to the exact ingredients in Ledesma\u2019s secret sauce. To a man, however, Australia\u2019s players agree that technique alone has not turned a scrum that appeared a liability against England at Twickenham 11 months ago into a weapon. Harder work and a tougher mentality have been vital, too.\n\nWhen Ledesma joined Australian rugby as forwards\u2019 coach earlier this year, he told his players he wanted them to focus on staying straight in the scrum and pushing hard, with power directed through the hooker. There was plenty of tough love, too \u2013 including two scrummaging sessions a day and scrums that became lengthy tug-of-wars, backwards and forwards for 30 seconds or more. It wasn\u2019t pleasant but it worked.\n\nAs the prop Scott Sio explains: \u201cMario drawing out those sessions has allowed us mentally to understand that attitude is half the battle out there. As strong as you can be and however great your technique is, if you\u2019re not prepared to get on top of your opposition you\u2019ve already lost half the battle. We\u2019ve had some very heated sessions and that\u2019s what you need going into these big games.\u201d\n\nJust talking more, as Sio admits, has helped, too. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out there training, you know what you need from your flanker or second-row and he knows what to expect from his props, so we can call each out on it if we don\u2019t think we\u2019re working hard enough,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to be honest with each other, you\u2019re not going to be able to grow as a squad.\u201d\n\nIt is not uncommon for Ledesma to roll into the scrum on his back, like a mechanic inspecting a car\u2019s engine, to check everything is functioning properly. He is far happier now \u2013 and so, understandably, is the Australian coach, Michael Cheika.\n\n\u201cMario always does his job to the maximum, he gives 120% each time that he is with the team for the scrum and the maul,\u201d he said, approvingly. \u201cMario has the knowledge, technique and a philosophy and the dedication to go to the end. He is someone who is very effective at his job. He does the work and spends the time reflecting on what he is going to do, so he doesn\u2019t just arrive at training and make up his mind there and say \u2018let\u2019s do this\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe also takes the players to one side and deals with them individually. He has also been a success on the human front as he has touched the players in a very positive way with his emotions.\u201d\n\nThose emotions are likely to be highly fierce and primal on Sunday but the Australian lock Sam Carter believes his side will be able to able to handle what is thrown at them. \u201cThe match is definitely going to be won up front,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know Argentina have a very good set piece and they are willing to throw their bodies into everything.\n\n\u201cBut we have put a lot of work into our scrum and we\u2019ve responded really well to the passion Mario brings.

Brendan will pretend that he is sad to see him go but smart cookie that he is, Brendan already has a replacement ready to go in the shape of Luciano Vietto. The 21-year old Villarreal striker has no caps for Argentina, has had one decent half-season and very little experience playing at the highest level and so sounds just like the sort of proven forward that Liverpool are in need of.\n\nOver at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal is angry but his anger is not aimed at people who talk at gigs. (Van Gaal doesn\u2019t go to gigs, he just stays at home, sits in his favourite chair and plays recordings of his best press conferences at very loud volume, laughing to himself when he knows a particularly good verbal slap-down is on its way.)

He has a lot of quality, but needs to prove he can play for the team and make the difference within a squad dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe wily old coach expects high standards when it comes to conduct. Graziano Pell\u00e8 was sent home from this World Cup qualification double header after refusing to shake his manager\u2019s hand when he was substituted against Spain, and so left Italy a striker short for Sunday\u2019s game in Macedonia.\n\nBalotelli\u2019s first few weeks in Nice have gone better than almost anyone could have expected. The club had been an excellent choice for Hatem Ben Arfa, another tricky customer who had trouble finding the right environment to express his talent, to relaunch himself. Balotelli flew into Cote d\u2019Azur with his enormous baggage. Was it reasonable to expect another success story in Nice? Not a lot conforms to sound judgment in the world of Balotelli, but he has unpacked, lightened his load, and looks happy again on the field. A goal rush of six from five games has everyone gushing.\n\nIf Balotelli\u2019s arrival on transfer deadline day felt like a marriage of convenience, pretty quickly both sides are looking extremely happy with one another. A club on the rise under new ownership have an exciting prize who is headline news. Balotelli is finding his form, behaving well, and ready to challenge deep-set opinions. \u201cHe can get back on top of the world,\u201d said the club\u2019s manager, Lucien Favre. \u201cYou have to be blind not to see how good he is in front of goal.\u201d There has been variety to his goals too \u2013 the trademark cool penalty, a close-range header, the long-range screamer, a powerful run and clinical finish.\n\nTogether Nice and Balotelli are top of the table. The club are benefitting not only from his presence on the field, but also from the attention. Their man is a cover story every day. They boast a charismatic personality capable of at least trying to saunter into the Zlatan Ibrahimovic-shaped hole. Publicity-wise, as far as the French league is concerned, what Zlatan taketh away, Super Mario giveth. Balotelli is a big part of the show.\n\nThat was crystallised by the reaction to his unfortunate red card having scored a scorching winner against Lorient. A second booking was harsh and the media circus cranked up. Before long the referee released a statement to say he had made a mistake, and even the president of Lyon, who would have benefitted from a banned Balotelli since they meet after the international break, spoke out on the player\u2019s behalf. Balotelli has now had the red card overturned.\n\nIt is interesting that, in an echo of his ill-starred move to Liverpool, Balotelli was courted by the men upstairs rather than the head coach. Favre at first seemed as dubious as Brendan Rodgers was when the Italian was delivered to him at Anfield in 2014. Favre\u2019s message was plain at the start: play well and act professional and you can be part of the squad. Play badly and act up and it will not be indulged.\n\nHaving had so many false restarts, many were doubtful that this Balotelli would be any different from the player who has drifted to frustrating fringes recently. But so far his attitude has been as impressive as his displays. He is not yet fully fit or fully sharp. Favre hopes there is more to come, with the extra training sessions paying off to make him more rounded than a spearhead who is in the right place to bang in goals right now. \u201cHe will get back to his best if he is professional from head to toe,\u201d says the manager.\n\nItaly play Liechtenstein and Germany next month. Balotelli once again has something to aim for."]], "2013-05-02": [[["Larry Elliott"], "00:00:00", "Financial markets have a lot of faith in Mario Draghi. Too much faith, in all likelihood. They rallied last summer when the president of the European Central Bank said he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. And they rallied on Thursday when the ECB cut interest rates to 0.5%. Bond yields fell across the eurozone, hitting record lows in France and dropping below 10% in Greece. Stock markets liked the news, too.\n\nBut did the news warrant the upbeat response? Not really. Let's be clear, the reduction in the cost of borrowing for the eurozone was welcome. It was also signalled in advance, long overdue, and the bare minimum that the ECB could have delivered when recession is deepening quarter by quarter and Japanese-style deflation appears to be just around the corner.\n\nDraghi hinted that the ECB might consider negative deposit rates, which would mean that banks would have to pay for the privilege of parking money at Europe's central bank. That threat, it is hoped, will encourage banks to lend rather than hoard their cash. And he said the ECB would consult with the European Investment Bank and the European commission about the possibility of measures that could boost credit flows to small- and medium-sized companies.\n\nBy no stretch of the imagination does this amount to a rescue plan for a eurozone facing a second calendar year of declining output and with unemployment at a record 12.1% and rising. The Bank of England had its Funding for Lending Scheme in place by the middle of 2012; the ECB is still at the drawing board stage.\n\nThis is perhaps not surprising. The ECB is a conservative institution, although it has become less so under Draghi's stewardship. Its freedom of action is constrained by Germany's insistence that the problems of the troubled countries of the eurozone are caused by the lack of structural reform, and not insufficient demand. It was clear from Draghi's press conference that the decision was not unanimous and it did not take a genius to surmise that Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, was a dissenting voice.\n\nSo why are markets so chipper? We can rule out the idea that the ECB's rate cut will prompt a recovery in output. (Although it may help, at the margin, to underpin consumer and business confidence.) The decline in Greek bond yields suggests that the markets believe the risks of a break-up of the single currency have markedly diminished since Draghi issued his \"whatever it takes\" reassurance in July 2012. The immediate threat to monetary union is certainly diminished, but it is a heroic assumption \u2013 given the deepening slump, the recurrent sovereign debt crises and the structural differences between rich and poor countries \u2013 to imagine that the risk of break-up has disappeared altogether.\n\nNo, what we are really witnessing here is a touching belief in the ability and willingness of central banks to prevent investors suffering losses. In the early part of the last decade there was something known as the Greenspan put: every time Wall Street was in trouble, the chairman of the Federal Reserve would ride to the rescue with a cut in interest rates. In 2013 we have the Bernanke put, the King put and now the Draghi put. Bad economic news is treated by the markets as good economic news, because they believe lower interest rates or more quantitative easing will follow. Eventually one of two things happens: the recovery actually does arrive.

Tottenham\u2019s first of two crucial games this week will be remembered for a dreadful error by Roberto Soldado and two defensive lapses as much as it will for Fiorentina\u2019s decisiveness in attack, La Viola advancing following a game that, like the first leg, started well for Spurs but ended lamentably.\n\nIn many ways Pochettino\u2019s selection backfired. He made seven changes and left Harry Kane and Andros Townsend on the bench until the 63rd minute. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, of course, and perhaps it will pay off against Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday but, as the goals flew in from Mario G\u00f3mez and Mohamed Salah during a devastating second-half spell for Fiorentina, there was an overwhelming sense that this was an opportunity missed.\n\nIronically their chief tormenter, Salah, is still a Chelsea player, on loan from the west London club as part of the deal in which Juan Cuadrado departed Florence this winter. Pochettino will hope his defenders cope better in the Capital One Cup final but, on this evidence, there are concerns, given that both Fiorentina\u2019s goals emerged after lapses in concentration, despite the excellent finishes.\n\nSoldado wasted a glorious chance when one-on-one with Neto, the Brazilian goalkeeper, in the 29th minute \u2013 opting to pass when shooting was the better option. His dallying was in marked contrast to the swift fashion with which G\u00f3mez and Salah dispatched their chances later in the game.\n\nPochettino, while not singling out Soldado, put it quite simply. \u201cIf you don\u2019t score it\u2019s difficult to win games,\u201d said the Spurs coach. \u201cI think in the first half we played very well and created some chances.

The key moment, though, came after 29 minutes.\n\nSoldado, who had been linking up well with his midfield, broke the offside trap following a deft through ball from \u00c9rik Lamela. The Viola defence was flat-footed, and the action for a moment slowed as the Spaniard bore down on goal, but instead of shooting Soldado attempted to lay the ball off to Nacer Chadli and Neto claimed with ease.\n\nFiorentina made Tottenham pay and improved vastly in the second half. Nine minutes in and G\u00f3mez showed Soldado how one-on-one opportunities should be dispatched. Milan Badelj \u2013 who had missed a fine chance of his own just minutes earlier \u2013 pounced on a poor touch from Federico Fazio and played in the German forward, who outpaced Ben Davies to race through and slot under Hugo Lloris. It was a clinical strike from a player who has struggled for goals of late, and Vincenzo Montella\u2019s side almost increased their lead soon after.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn dispossessed Lamela in midfield and played in Salah, who again left Davies eating dust, only to be denied by an excellent save from Lloris, the Frenchman blocking with this legs.\n\nSpurs were on the rack and the change in momentum prompted a double substitution from Pochettino, Kane and Townsend brought on for Nabil Bentaleb and Chadli. Toni Jim\u00e9nez, the goalkeeping coach, had already been sent to the stands by the referee as the tie began to ebb away.\n\nIt was soon all over. Salah picked the ball up on the right touchline in an advanced position and darted inside, playing a one-two with G\u00f3mez who flicked the ball back into his path. Salah entered the penalty area and Jan Vertonghen, who had appeared to have quelled the threat, inexplicably failed to clear and granted Salah time to shoot following a terribly cumbersome touch.

For now inflation remains well short of that and could turn negative again in coming months, he added.\n\nDraghi warned that those who threatened ECB independence with \u201ccriticisms of a certain type\u201d were making Europe\u2019s economic problems worse.\n\n\u201cWe have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the eurozone not only for Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d\n\nAngela Merkel countered that it was legitimate for Germans to discuss how far interest rates had fallen, but \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be confused with interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is independent in its policies,\u201d the German chancellor told reporters while on a visit to the Netherlands.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s ECB news conference in Frankfurt Draghi said a range of initiatives announced in March would need time to bear fruit but he insisted the bank\u2019s stance was working. In last month\u2019s unprecedented package of growth-bolstering measures, the ECB cut interest rates to an all-time low, expanded its money-printing programme and reduced a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory.\n\nThere had been some speculation in financial markets before Thursday that faced with global uncertainties and an ongoing threat of deflation, the ECB could cut rates further still and launch \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 whereby central banks print money so finance ministries can hand it out to citizens to spend.\n\nBut Draghi was swift to snuff out speculation and said the ECB had not discussed helicopter money. He did emphasise, however, that borrowing costs would stay low and he hinted they could possibly be cut even further.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,\u201d the ECB chief said in his opening statement to the press conference.\n\nThat outlook will infuriate many German savers, frustrated by years of low returns on their pension pots. But Draghi rejected implications that the ECB was responsible for all the problems of pension funds.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that pension funds and others, insurance companies, are seriously affected by the low interest rates. I would caution them not to blame on low rates everything that has gone wrong in the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nDraghi also renewed the pressure on governments to play a role in shoring up growth in the eurozone, echoing recent comments by the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Christine Lagarde that central banks alone cannot fuel the recovery.\n\n\u201cLow interest rates are a symptom of low growth and low inflation. If we want to return to higher interest rates we need to return to higher growth and higher inflation,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the UK\u2019s June referendum on EU membership, Draghi said: \u201cThe participation of Britain in the EU is welcome,.

The attacking midfielder\u2019s career has stalled at Bayern Munich, where he has made only 12 appearances this season, and he is keen on a move away from the Allianz Arena despite the impending arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as Pep Guardiola\u2019s replacement.\n\nBayern want almost \u00a330m for the player they signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2013 but Liverpool hope a deal can be agreed for \u00a315m-\u00a320m. That valuation is based on G\u00f6tze having only 12 months remaining on his Bayern contract at the end of this season and his reluctance to sign an extension.\n\nArsenal are also interested in the player who scored Germany\u2019s winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final but the attraction of working with Klopp for a second time has given Liverpool a significant advantage. G\u00f6tze enjoyed the finest period of his career for Klopp at Dortmund, scoring 22 goals in 83 Bundesliga appearances and playing a key role in the club\u2019s two Bundesliga titles, one German Cup success and progress to the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nThe combination of a fresh start away from Bayern plus renewing acquaintances with Klopp is believed to appeal to the Germany international, who has found opportunities limited under Guardiola and struggled with injuries during his time in Bavaria.

Super Mario Run almost certainly is that game though.\n\nUnveiled at Apple\u2019s WWDC event in June, it will be an iOS exclusive when it launches on 15 December, although an Android port is expected to follow in 2017.\n\nIn November, Nintendo revealed the launch date and confirmed that Super Mario Run will be free to download and try, with a single $9.99 in-app purchase (likely \u00a37.99 in the UK) unlocking the rest of the game.\n\nThat month, Nintendo also gathered journalists for a hands-on demonstration of its first iPhone game, with one line in particular repeated several times by the company\u2019s reps: \u201cA true Mario platformer that you can play entirely with one hand.\u201d\n\nThe messaging around Super Mario Run isn\u2019t a surprise, with Nintendo hoping to scotch two fears for fans: first, that the classic Super Mario gameplay will be dumbed down for a massively mainstream mobile audience, and second that the translation from joypads to touchscreens will be botched.\n\nBased on the almost-finished code, it\u2019s looking good on both fronts.\n\nFrom the finely tuned jumping mechanic to the level design, Super Mario Run feels like a proper (and new) Mario game, with plenty of nods back to earlier games for hardcore fans, but a well-crafted one-tap control system to suit its new medium.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Mario Run\u2019s World Tour levels.\n\nThere are three main parts to Super Mario Run: its main World Tour mode; its Toad Rally challenge mode; and the Kingdom Builder mode that sits between the other two. The free download will let you play the game\u2019s first three levels in both World Tour and Toad Rally modes, as well as a 20-second demo of the fourth.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve paid your \u00a37.99 to unlock the full game, there are no more in-app purchases. While spending virtual coins is a key part of the game, they\u2019re only earned by playing, not by paying.\n\nTaking the Tour\n\nSuper Mario Run is a blend of traditional Mario platformers and modern endless-runners. Mario automatically runs from left to right and clambers over small obstacles, while you tap lightly for a little jump and harder for a bigger leap.\n\nThere\u2019s more to it than that: you can wall-kick your way up shafts, while strategically placed blocks help you stop for a few seconds, jump backwards or take bigger leaps forward.\n\nThe interface has been designed so that you tap on the bottom fifth of the screen below the level window, so as not to obscure any action with your thumb. The iPad version has a thinner tap zone to keep more of its screen free for the levels.\n\nAs with all Mario games, replayability is key. Each level initially includes five pink coins among the regular gold ones. Collect the five, and a harder \u201cpurple coin\u201d version of the level is unlocked.\n\nCollect all five purple coins in that, and an even harder \u201cblack coin\u201d version unlocks where, in the words of Nintendo\u2019s demonstrator, \u201cthey expect you to be a bit more fancy\u201d with your acrobatics to collect everything.\n\nThere are plenty of alternative routes and secrets to find as you play through the game, while a bubble button can be tapped twice per level to float Mario backwards for a while: useful if you\u2019ve missed a crucial coin, or just want to maximise your score by taking another route.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Mario Run\u2019s Kingdom Builder mode and its shop.\n\nRally to the challenge\n\nAs you play through the World Tour mode you\u2019ll earn gold coins and rally tickets, which are used in Super Mario Run\u2019s other two modes: Toad Rally and Kingdom Builder.\n\nToad Rally is a challenge mode that costs one rally ticket to enter. You choose a level, then another player whose performance you want to try to beat. Your score is a combination of the coins you collect and the watching Toad characters that you \u201cimpress\u201d by pulling off acrobatic leaps.\n\nBeat the player you\u2019ve challenged, and you\u2019ll earn a bunch of colourful (red, blue, green, purple and/or yellow) Toads, but like spread betting, if you don\u2019t beat the other player, you\u2019ll lose Toads.\n\nWhat do Toads mean? Prizes. Or rather, you need a certain number of each to unlock items in the game\u2019s Kingdom Builder mode, where you spend your coins buying items to place in your mini-kingdom \u2013 some of which are purely decorative, while others \u2026 are not.\n\n(Nintendo is keeping some features of the game, the contents of its shop included, under wraps until it launches.)\n\nCoins, raffle tickets and Toads may sound like a potentially confusing system of interlocking virtual currencies. That said, it all seems to make sense within Super Mario Run, and many mobile gamers have already encountered similar systems in freemium games.\n\nReason for optimism\n\nGiven 2016 was a year of unpleasant surprises, Nintendo\u2019s fanbase would be forgiven for fretting about Super Mario Run being a crashing disappointment. Based on the preview code, it\u2019s looking more like one of the year\u2019s silver linings.\n\nIts developers appear to have walked the line between casual and hardcore players with success: you can play your way through the levels fairly easily at your own pace, albeit with the odd moment that may test the reflexes and rhythm of players whose experience is more Candy Crush than classic platformers.\n\nIf you\u2019re a speed-runner or a collect-everything completist, though, Super Mario Run looks to have plenty to challenge you, including additional characters to unlock \u2013 Luigi and Yoshi are the ones we\u2019re allowed to mention for now.\n\nOne question concerns whether Nintendo is planning to expand on the game\u2019s six worlds in the coming months with the new levels and characters that mobile players have been trained to expect from their freemium games.\n\nIf Nintendo does follow suit, it will have to decide whether to charge for them, although based on the quality of the first few worlds in Super Mario Run, it will have a good case for doing so.

His 85th-minute penalty provoked a dispute with Jordan Henderson on the pitch and a rebuke from Steven Gerrard sitting in a television studio, but all that mattered was that it was nerveless, accurate and broke Besiktas\u2019 resilience in the Europa League. At long last he is making a difference.\n\nBalotelli has contributed more to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side in the past 10 days than throughout his first five months at Anfield and his late winner could prove essential to Liverpool\u2019s progress in Europe. Last Tuesday his first Premier League goal defeated Tottenham Hotspur and enhanced Liverpool\u2019s top-four claims. On Saturday he was involved in Adam Lallana\u2019s winner in the FA Cup at Crystal Palace and here, with Rodgers\u2019 men struggling to break down the Turkish league leaders and destined for another daunting European task at the Ataturk Stadium, he stepped forward to deliver a slender but important first-leg victory.\n\nBalotelli being Balotelli, his goal was not without controversy and Rodgers appeared distinctly unimpressed when the Italian took spot-kick duties away from the captain, Henderson, after Jordon Ibe had been foolishly clipped inside the area by Ramon Motta. Unlike a similar tale across Stanley Park recently, when Kevin Mirallas ousted Leighton Baines and missed from the spot, Balotelli coolly sent Cenk Gonen the wrong way and Liverpool were reprieved.\n\nChances were scarce for both sides in a closely fought match and Balotelli\u2019s understandable confidence from 12 yards \u2013 he has now scored 27 out of 29 penalties in his career \u2013 ensured Liverpool did not reach a sixth European game without a win for the first time in the club\u2019s history.\n\nBesiktas reflected a coach who spent his playing career in central defence for Croatia, West Ham United and Everton. \u201cI like to see good football,\u201d Bilic had explained before his return to Merseyside. \u201cBut I think only good defensive organisation will give you the opportunity to be effective in attack.\u201d He remained true to that philosophy by deploying two banks of four to nullify a Liverpool attack led by Daniel Sturridge but missing Raheem Sterling\u2019s ability to stretch a well-drilled opposition defence for 77 minutes.\n\nSterling started on the bench having missed the last two matches with a foot problem and, along with everyone else inside the stadium, was quickly aware of Bilic\u2019s intention to keep things tight before next week\u2019s second leg in Istanbul. A stalemate developed quickly with Liverpool struggling to create space behind the Turkish defence or to deliver a quality final ball.\n\nThere was more entertainment in watching Bilic\u2019s antics in the technical area. The Croat kicked every pass, jumped to head every high ball into the box, railed at the Polish referee, sank to his haunches when Liverpool attacked and leapt up and down as Besiktas formed a wall to defend a Jordan Henderson free-kick from 25 yards.\n\nHenderson\u2019s effort landed inches wide, with Cenk rooted on the opposite side of goal. Alberto Moreno also went close from distance, so too Sturridge from a free-kick 25 yards out, and the fact Liverpool\u2019s threats all arrived from outside the area reflected the struggle to break through the Besiktas\u2019 rearguard. The visitors were not without their chances too, however.\n\nAnfield was transported back to April and that Chelsea goal that punctured Liverpool\u2019s title dream when Demba Ba was sent sprinting through on the Kop goal by Olcay Sahan. This time Ba shot low to Simon Mignolet\u2019s left rather than through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs and the Belgian produced a fine save to tip the ball out for a corner.\n\nHaving struggled to create one clear opening throughout the first half, Liverpool squandered two presentable chances within four minutes of the restart. The first fell to Moreno after Ibe beat two Besiktas challenges and fed Henderson, who picked out the unmarked Spaniard with a floated cross to the left of the area.\n\nMoreno\u2019s volley was not exactly clean or accurate and ended up at the feet of Sturridge wide on the right.\n\nLallana missed a better opportunity gifted to him by a mix-up in the visiting defence. Again Henderson was involved, bursting down the right and delivering a cross that should have been routine for Cenk.\n\nInstead he collided with the central defender Pedro Franco and dropped the ball towards the in-rushing Liverpool midfielder who, under pressure from Franco\u2019s challenge, skied over from close range. It was a major let-off for Bilic\u2019s side but Ibe ensured they would not escape completely when he drove beyond Motta who responded with a needless foul.\n\nBalotelli finished the job and ignited another controversy in the process."]], "2016-08-22": [[[], "00:00:00", "Name: Shinzo Abe.\n\nAge: 61.\n\nAppearance: Italian plumber.\n\nThat\u2019s not what he looks like, is it?

But even the core inflation rate, which strips out the more volatile goods, was cause for concern, said Alasdair Cavalla at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. It rose to 0.9% from 0.8%, which was \"better, but still far short of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2.0%,\" Cavalla said.\n\n\"The weakness of demand means that core inflation is also at risk of falling.

Raheem Sterling was sidelined with a foot injury suffered in the FA Cup replay at Bolton Wanderers, Lucas Leiva for the next four to six weeks with a thigh problem, and Spurs arrived buoyed by the derby win over Arsenal and with the confidence generated by only one defeat in 10 league games.\n\nBut Daniel Sturridge returned for his first league start since Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 win at White Hart Lane in August and would influence another defeat for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team, their fifth in succession in this fixture. The striker\u2019s first two chances stemmed from wayward passes by Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb as Tottenham\u2019s carelessness in midfield supplied Liverpool\u2019s attack consistently in the first half. Inevitable rustiness from Sturridge reprieved the visitors on those occasions.\n\nLazar Markovic volleyed over from close range and Lloris made an excellent save to deny Sturridge after Jordan Ibe combined with the Serb down the right. The Tottenham keeper\u2019s next intervention was less impressive, however, as he and his defenders failed to deal with a routine clearance down the field from Simon Mignolet. Vertonghen\u2019s unconvincing challenge on Sturridge rebounded kindly into the path of Markovic, Eric Dier dropped off for reasons best known to himself and the \u00a320m summer signing from Benfica scuffed his shot beyond Lloris\u2019s weak left hand and into the bottom corner.\n\nTottenham responded positively. Emre Can threw himself in the way of a Christian Eriksen shot and the Dane then combined neatly with Erik Lamela to create a 23rd goal of the season for Harry Kane. Liverpool failed to exert sufficient pressure on the Spurs\u2019 pair outside the area, Mamadou Sakho slipped as Lamela played a disguised pass into the box and Kane was left free to drive in the equaliser between Mignolet\u2019s legs.\n\nThe game continued to flow and Sturridge almost restored Liverpool\u2019s advantage in nonchalant style when Ibe\u2019s right-wing cross deflected into his path six yards out. The Liverpool striker was facing away from goal and surrounded by several white shirts but back-flicked the ball against the outside of a post.\n\nTottenham started the second half with purpose but it was Liverpool who regained the lead when Danny Rose was adjudged to have clipped Sturridge inside the area. Phil Dowd waved play on after the striker tumbled over the left-back\u2019s outstretched leg only for his assistant to signal for a foul. Steven Gerrard converted the spot-kick just beyond Lloris\u2019 finger-tips for his 10th goal of his farewell Liverpool season before being replaced with a slight hamstring problem.\n\nThere was further controversy when Spurs levelled for a second time. Gerrard was booked for a foul that wasn\u2019t on Eriksen, who drew a fine save from Mignolet from the resulting free-kick, albeit with the ball dropping to Kane inside the area.\n\nKane squared \u2013 from an offside position, claimed Liverpool \u2013 and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was able to convert with his chest from close range. The offside appeals went unheeded but Balotelli, at last, would have the final word. \u201cIt was a great game and while I\u2019m disappointed with the result, I\u2019m also proud of the effort of our players,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cWe were unlucky.\u201d"]], "2016-08-25": [[["Phillip Inman"], "00:00:00", ""]], "2015-06-25": [[["Alberto Nardelli", "George Arnett"], "00:00:00", "When they arrive at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels for a crucial summit on Thursday, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and the 26 other EU leaders will have no need of a badge. They will be given a pin instead. It provides access to all areas, including to an undisclosed safe room in the remote case of an emergency (a bit like in Homeland. Or Josh Lyman\u2019s nuclear emergency card in the first series of The West Wing).\n\nEverybody else involved in the European Council (Euco) meeting has to make do with a badge. How good that badge is \u2013 how many doors it will open and how many floors of the building remain off-limits in spite of it \u2013 is largely communicated by its colour. Gold, for instance, gets you to the \u201c80th floor\u201d (which, depending on how you count it, is actually the seventh floor). This is where you want to be. It is where stuff gets decided. But the most important perk is access to the VIP meals. No gold, no party.\n\nLike everything in Brussels, there\u2019s a power structure, and not only is it complicated, it\u2019s colour-coded. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nDuring Euco meetings, normal access badges to the building \u2013 even regular diplomatic ones \u2013 don\u2019t work. All participants are issued with special badges, and the type of badge decides which parts of the building \u2013 and which meetings \u2013 you can access.

If you\u2019re lucky enough to have gold, and thus access to the 80th floor, there\u2019s the VIP dinner \u2013 one feature of which is that there is no note-taking. A tighter confidentiality regime applies on this floor of the building, and this is where, on Thursday evening, Cameron will lay out his plans for renegotiating the terms of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.\n\nAmbassadors and their \u201cantici\u201d (jargon for powerful assistant and scribe) have red badges. One peculiarity of the Euco system is that note-taking during meetings often takes place in a separate room.\n\nA level below these are the blue and grey badges used by delegation members and admin personnel. They spend most of their time on the \u201c50th floor\u201d, which includes meeting rooms, delegation rooms and the presidency room.\n\nAfter that it gets more complicated. Alongside the regular badges each country delegation also gets a number of floaters. These work like the \u201cpower-up mushroom\u201d in Super Mario Bros: participants with a floater are temporarily of bigger status until the floater is taken away from them.\n\nA gold floater works with red or blue badges and allows much-coveted access to the 80th floor. A delegation usually gets two of these.\n\nThe red L floater only works with a blue badge and gives access to the leaders\u2019 lounge. The red floater also works with a grey badge but it gives access only to the 50th floor.\n\nAt the foot of the House of Lanyards are badges for drivers, and yellow ones used to access the briefing areas and press rooms.\n\nIf you do have a badge, and find yourself lost in the Justus Lipsius building, here\u2019s a handy reminder of where everything is:\n\nLevel 02: VIP entrance. This is at the back of the building where the convoys can drive in.\n\nLevel 00: Schuman entrance.

Expectations are so high that the rumoured \u20ac500bn (\u00a3390bn) programme of buying sovereign bonds might be viewed as a disappointment. The ECB is late to the QE party and deflation has arrived already in the eurozone.\n\nHow about \u20ac1tn? That would be more impressive. But investors might conclude that a cap of any size betrays German hesitation and objections. Draghi, remember, is the man who, in another context, coined the phrase \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d.\n\nThere is also the outside possibility, of course, that the ECB does nothing next week and opts to reconsider QE at its March meeting. That would astound markets. Investors might conclude that an ECB that can\u2019t summon the unity to launch QE in the current economic climate is incapable of saving the euro.\n\nDraghi is in a horrible position.

Well, the wound is definitely not mortal but it will cause some pain, to judge by BT\u2019s angry reaction. \u201cMisconceived\u201d is a word the telecoms company reserves for occasions when it is seriously miffed. An appeal is almost certain.\n\nAt one level, the row is merely technical. Should the cost of providing \u201cfree\u201d football and other sports to BT\u2019s superfast broadband customers be included when calculating the company\u2019s overall cost-base for fibre?\n\nOfcom says yes and its answer matters because the regulator wants to introduce a \u201cmargin squeeze\u201d test on BT to ensure that competitors can make a profit when they buy access to the group\u2019s fibre network. BT must maintain a decent gap between its wholesale prices for fibre and the prices it charges its own retail broadband customers.\n\nThe margin test was expected, and wouldn\u2019t itself cause BT to splutter. But the inclusion of sports costs in the calculations will make the test harder to pass. Failure would mean BT would have to raise its retail prices or cut its wholesale prices, thereby giving rivals a leg-up.\n\nThe good news for BT is that it has passed the test this time. But that\u2019s as things stand today. Champions League footie is coming to BT Sport and the next round of bidding for Premier League action has almost arrived. The latter could affect the squeeze test if BT bids high on Premier League rights and wins. Ofcom intends to apply the same regulatory logic to any mobile offers that are bundled into superfast broadband deals. That, perhaps, is even more significant as BT is in the process of buying EE for \u00a312.5bn.\n\nThe way BT tells it, it is the pay-TV challenger trying to give Sky a run for its money for the first time in 25 years. Well, yes, that\u2019s true, and the ambition is laudable. But it is surely also reasonable to ensure that non-football fans don\u2019t contribute via the back door to the great corporate BT/Sky sports showdown.

What did he expect?\n\nWalden, of course, is not that naive. Argos joined the Black Friday malarkey but tried not to get sucked in too deeply. Thus Argos\u2019s like-for-like sales were weak \u2013 the rise was just 0.1% in the final three months of 2014 \u2013 but the group protected its profit margins.\n\nIn theory, that ought to have reassured investors; in practice, the shares fell 6%. But one can understand why. Non-food retailers have got themselves into a fine old mess by importing the Black Friday nonsense from the US.\n\nMost promise to slow things down next time. But that\u2019s what they say now, when the chaos in the supply chain feels fresh. Next November, one suspects, they won\u2019t be able to help themselves.\n\nSomebody should break ranks and run Black Friday in August, when the wheeze might be a useful way of drumming up demand in a quiet month.

It held steady, helped by a 7% increased in Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, which posted its second-biggest one-day gain in three years.\n\nThe rally in Japan was prompted by weaker than expected growth figures, which led to speculation that the Bank of Japan would also step in to shore up the economy.\n\nThe rally had already helped set a positive tone for European markets, which rose further after Draghi spoke. The FTSE 100 closed 2% higher at 5,824.28 with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2.7% to 9,206.84, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rising 3% to close at 4,115.25.\n\nIn the UK, Ian McCafferty, who sits on the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting body, the monetary policy committee, was also indicating that Threadneedle Street could act.\n\nDespite the environment of low interest rates, which might hamper policymakers\u2019 ability to inject stimulus, McCafferty said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t believe we are out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThere was scope to cut interest rates and revive its bond-buying programme if the economy lurches downward, or even impose negative interest rates. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, McCafferty, who had been voting for a rate rise until this month, said: \u201cI think an immediate rate rise isn\u2019t as necessary as I had felt last autumn.\u201d\n\nNext month is the seventh anniversary of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to lower official interest rates to 0.5%.

At Axa, the forecasts for global GDP for 2016 were cut to 2.7%, down from 3.1%, while analysts at Berenberg said the slower start to the year had forced it to reduce its 2016 forecast for the US to 2.1%, from 2.3%.

The data for Chinese exports was even worse. A signal for the financial markets to have another dose of the heebie-jeebies? Not a bit of it. This was one of those days when bad news was good news.\n\nThe thinking goes as follows. If the Japanese economy shrank by 0.4% in the final three months of 2015 and Chinese exports fell by more than 11%, policymakers will sit up and take notice. Central banks will stimulate activity by cutting interest rates, even when they are already negative, and by expanding their quantitative easing (QE) programmes.\n\nRight on cue, Mario Draghi popped up before the European parliament to administer a bit of his own soothing balm. Yes, of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) is abreast of what has been going on in the markets, and \u201cwill not hesitate to act\u201d if necessary.\n\nMarkets took this as a promise from the ECB president that he will come up with more stimulus next month. More stimulus equals more growth equals higher corporate profits equals higher share prices.\n\nA moment\u2019s thought suggests this is a far from watertight thesis. For a start, financial markets should wait and see what Draghi does rather than get too excited about what he says. The ECB disappointed in December by not delivering as much extra stimulus as expected, in large part because Draghi ran into resistance from Germany.\n\nEven if the ECB does come up with the goods and this is accompanied by more action from the Bank of Japan and the People\u2019s Bank of China, there is no guarantee that it will have any material effect. There has been no shortage of action from central banks these past seven years and, let\u2019s be honest, the outcome has been disappointing.\n\nAndrew Lapthorne, analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, notes that one of the ploys being used by central banks \u2013 negative interest rates\u2013 is subject to the law of unintended consequences. Negative interest rates make holding government bonds attractive even when they are yielding next to nothing. Yet one of the rationales for QE is that it discourages investors from holding government bonds and encourages them to dabble in riskier assets.\n\nAll this prompts the conclusion that bad economic news really is bad news. In the current climate, there are really only two groups of people. Those who admit they don\u2019t really have a clue what\u2019s going on and those that don\u2019t have a clue but pretend that they do.

The intense moments that seemed to follow him around appear to be toned down these days, because he spends too much time on the periphery. Balotelli, this singular character, this impetuous talent who can tie his coaches in knots because they know what qualities lurk beneath all the complexity if only they could coax them to shine, is at yet another career crossroads. But the trouble is, these junctures are markers forming a pattern of gradual decline. Balotelli\u2019s moments are not as charasmatic. They are less frequent. It isn\u2019t him anywhere near often enough and that\u2019s a pity.\n\nWith Liverpool the third club in as many years to reach a shrugging acceptance that it isn\u2019t working out (following Manchester City in 2013 and Milan in 2014) it\u2019s hard to envisage where or how Balotelli might fulfil a bit more of the bristling potential that captured the imagination when he burst onto the scene. Here was a teenager with a powerful mix of maverick talent and idiosyncratic personality. The challenge to harness it has tempted most of his managers, notably Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter, Roberto Mancini at Man City and Cesare Prandelli with Italy, who were at once intrigued, endeared and driven to distraction by the enigma of Balotelli.\n\nTellingly, Brendan Rodgers seldom echoed that sentiment. There was always a coolness. A distance. The arrangement seemed doomed from the start, when Rodgers intimated in his welcome message when Balotelli moved to Anfield last summer that it was a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d and not really according to his plan.\n\nBalotelli turns 25 next month. His breakthrough season came at the age of 17. On the assumption that he is lucky enough with injuries to play until his early 30s, he is roughly halfway though his career. With his range of experience at important clubs and in the Italian national team, he should be approaching his peak years round about now.\n\nInstead he is contemplating how to revive a scenario that leaves him out of the main picture for his current club and his country. With Liverpool purchasing attacking players with intent, an exit strategy makes sense. But there may not be a queue of suitors willing take the gamble. Loose cannon plus poor form, multiplied by heavyweight salary, doesn\u2019t make a particularly attractive equation.\n\nIt was sobering to see the reaction of some Fiorentina tifosi when rumours of a transfer surfaced recently. There is some history between player and club from when he was the target of racist taunting in 2013, and a banner opposing his arrival this summer was pinned to the training ground. It read \u201cYou are a man without honour. Balotelli Florence doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThe uncomfortable undercurrent in Italy\u2019s relationship with Balotelli is one of the reasons he supposedly found it easier to be in England. But the move back to the Premier League a year ago has not easily given him the freedom to express himself, which leads to more doubt about the direction of this once promising career.\n\nFormer Italy manager Prandelli, who was always one of Balotelli\u2019s staunchest supporters, wanted the striker he described as a very sensitive person to become a \u201creference point\u201d for the Azzurri. Even putting to one side the sporting reasons, for all sorts of social and human reasons, that would be a wonderful thing. The son of Ghanaian immigrants, adopted by Holocaust survivors Francesco and Silvia in Brescia, his upbringing was uncommon in conservative northern Italy. The racism, the barriers, the love of his adoptive parents, the many questions he must have asked himself are all part of what makes him the person he is.\n\nHe is an unusual poster boy for Italian football, which is why it would be poignant for Balotelli to swing his career around, and to find the focus for his undeniable ability to flourish. He is capable of great things. His pair of goals to defeat Germany in the semi-final of Euro 2012 \u2013 one a predatory header, the other a rising thunderbolt \u2013 demonstrate that superbly.\n\nThe current Italy manager, Antonio Conte, has marginalised Balotelli from the national team. Dropped after Italy\u2019s demoralising World Cup last summer, he has not had much of an opportunity to re-stake his claim. Last Autumn, Conte suggested he didn\u2019t have the time to try to unlock the Balo conundrum. \u201cI\u2019m not so arrogant as to claim I\u2019m different from the great coaches, but the past tells us they failed to change Balotelli. It will be up to the player but I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\n\nBalotelli has a season ahead which feels profoundly defining. He needs \u2013 somewhere, somehow \u2013 to find a rhythm at club level. He has a European Championship to aspire to force his way into next summer in France.\n\nThe Liverpool experiment looks like a case of going to the wrong team at the wrong time. In fairness, Balotelli had company last season in the corner reserved for strikers Rodgers didn\u2019t seem to trust. Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini were there too. But Balotelli being Balotelli, the big character who carried a little more world superstar baggage than the other fringe forwards, there was always more of an issue there. Of course he didn\u2019t score enough goals, and generally didn\u2019t appear settled and secure. He showed flashes, but not enough to suggest he would flourish at Anfield.\n\nSo what now? According to Rodgers, the future \u201cwill be entirely up to Mario\u201d.

That such an assertion can be made \u2013 without the umistakable smack of hyperbole \u2013 surely shows what trouble the euro project is now in. Because no matter how innovative or bold Mr Draghi's response \u2013 and it was undoubtedly both \u2013 the success or failure of a currency, a single market, and a political project should never be in the gift of an unelected central banker and his equally unelected colleagues.\n\nYet throughout the panic and denial and firefighting of the past couple of years, two major trends in European policy-making are observable: first, economic power in the continent has shifted away from national governments and towards the European Central Bank; second, and this is surely related, European politicians and policymakers have omitted to make the case for why the euro should exist at all. Instead they assert that the euro must continue \u2013 \"whatever it takes\", as Mr Draghi said this summer \u2013 or they conflate austerity with the euro with Europe, as Angela Merkel repeatedly does. The result is that what has to be a grand, cross-national political project if it is to survive at all is no such thing; it is becoming ever more an elite project that is only able to endure at the costs of those lower down in society, especially in southern Europe. For those at the top: officially granted liquidity. For those at the bottom: unnegotiable austerity.\n\nThe announcement by Mr Draghi fits neatly into this pattern. The new plan to rescue the euro sounds complicated, but it really boils down to one thing: a guarantee that nations struggling to raise funds from financial markets will be helped out by the ECB. The scheme even has a name: outright monetary transactions, or OMT, or, as wags dubbed it, on my tab \u2013 since that is effectively what Mr Draghi is now offering the rest of the euro club, to put the mother of all credit cards behind the bar. The net result will be to wreck the ECB's balance sheet, but along the way there will also be strict austerity conditions. Before digging into the problems with this latest solution, one big acknowledgment must be made: this is about as big a step as the ECB could have taken.\n\nThe previous boss of Frankfurt, Jean-Claude Trichet, would barely have dreamed up such a scheme, let alone pushed it through. It is clear too that Germany has been forced to go along with this: it was as good as admitted that the Bundesbank opposed this scheme \u2013 a rather crucial no vote, given that it is the Germans who will have to act as paymasters-in-chief. In his imaginativeness and political astuteness, Mr Draghi has lived up to his side of the bargain to do \"whatever it takes\". Yet the plan, in its insistence on austerity conditions, is wrong-headed and, in total, not enough. The debt problems for Spain and Italy have worsened partly as a result of their economies slowing down: so strong-arming them into making ever more spending cuts will just intensify the death spiral. If you want a parallel, just look at George Osborne's double-dip recession, created with a very similar mix of \"fiscal conservatism and monetary activism\". As the chancellor has found, even after Mervyn King has thrown the best part of \u00a3400bn at the economy, a recovery can't be rustled up to order. Nor can spending cuts: just ask Madrid, which is having to bail out stricken provinces left, right and centre.\n\nThis argument should remind us of just how multifaceted the eurozone's problems are. There is the huge and pressing issue of the financing of Spanish and Italian government (and bank) debt; which Mr Draghi has tried to sort out. But then there is the economic problem of a whole chunk of the continent now heading deep into recession \u2013 and taking the rest down with it. There is the political problem of forcing cuts on voters. Finally, there is the biggest issue of all: of why exactly this configuration of the euro should be saved at all. On that last point, certainly, Mr Draghi won't be able to help."], [["Josephine Moulds"], "00:00:00", "Another day, another chance to save the world. It is not without reason that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is dubbed Super Mario.\n\nAfter just 10 months in the job, the 64-year-old Italian has by turns impressed, disappointed and perplexed the markets. His first decisive moves to cut rates to a record low of 1% and flood European banks with cheap money were widely hailed as having pulled the euro back from the brink. But his bombastic talk has often been misunderstood, sending markets haywire when the ECB fails to follow through with definite action.\n\nHe has a breadth of experience few central bankers can boast, spanning academia, government, the private sector and regulatory bodies. Educated at the prestigious US university MIT, he has taught at Harvard and is one of Europe's best economic minds. A stint at the World Bank in the 80s was followed by a job as director general of the Italian treasury. He then moved into the private sector, joining Goldman Sachs for five years, before taking on the thankless task of being governor of the Bank of Italy, where he was credited with helping steer Italy's debt-ridden economy through the crisis without requiring financial assistance. Most recently, he impressed as head of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global bank regulator that drafted the Basel III agreement \u2013 the new regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions.\n\nHis time in the US, in particular, is said to have influenced him, driving him to act early rather than take the German wait-and-see attitude that has often prevailed in Europe. He is said to be a good delegator, giving other members of the ECB governing board weighty roles and then letting them get on with it. Where his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, was known for being rigid and domineering, Draghi is applauded for encouraging discussion. Notably, ECB colleagues refer to Draghi as Mario, whereas Trichet was always Trichet.\n\nDraghi is careful to keep his private life private and is rarely seen in public with his wife. A few key facts are known about his past. He was orphaned in his mid-teens, when his biochemist mother and bank-executive father both died. Draghi was brought up by an aunt and later taken under the wing of Federico Caffe, a prominent Italian economist and university professor. A keen golfer, Draghi is said to maintain a work-life balance despite being in one of the most high-pressure jobs in the global economy.\n\nSome say his performance on Thursday will decide whether he can keep that job.

At the end of the review, the novelist Joshua Cohen suggested there might be something hypocritical about Vargas Llosa\u2019s condemnation of the infiltration of popular culture\u2019s values into high culture and in particular his trashing of trashy journalism. The 79-year-old, he pointed out, had recently appeared in Hola! (the Spanish parent magazine of Hello!) in an \u201cexclusive story\u201d revealing his new relationship with the socialite Isabel Preysler, ex-wife and mother respectively of the pop stars Julio and Enrique Iglesias, and told the celebrity weekly the affair was \u201cgoing very well\u201d.\n\nEnraged, the 2010 Nobel literature laureate thundered that he was \u201cflabbergasted to learn that this kind of gossip can find its way into a respectable publication such as the Book Review\u201d - a \u201cslanderous and perfidious\u201d instance of the convergence of posh and pop that his book inveighs against. \u201cI have never had a Twitter account\u201d, he insisted, and \u201chave never sold a story to Hola!\u201d, so Cohen had been wrong to assert (on the basis of a Daily Mail article, which recycled allegations in the Spanish press) that he had tweeted about the affair and been paid for the photo-feature. Both claims were deleted from the review, which now appears online with a humiliating triple correction beneath it, as originally it also misspelt Preysler\u2019s name.\n\nThe next day, the French novelist Michel Houellebecq similarly took up the cudgels against a broadsheet newspaper usually seen as earnest and respectable, even stuffy. As a curtain-raiser to the madness of France\u2019s \u201crentr\u00e9e litt\u00e9raire\u201d (589 novels will be published between mid-August and mid-October) and the stately unfolding of its literary prize season (the Goncourt 2015 longlist, presumably featuring Houellebecq\u2019s Submission, will be announced on Thursday), Le Monde had run a series of biographical articles about the scruffy, grumpy novelist, homing in on his drinking and his choice of home (a tower block in a far from fashionable part of Paris), and telling an anecdote of him being treated as a tramp when he stayed at a monastery for research. Houellebecq reacted by calling reporters \u201ccockroaches\u201d and accusing the writer of the series of making \u201cmalicious slyness\u201d her \u201ctrademark\u201d; more seriously, he argued that revealing his \u201cdaily habits\u201d would cause his police bodyguards difficulties (he is a potential target because of his past criticisms of Islam and Submission, which imagines a future France under an Islamist government and appeared on the same day as the Charlie Hebdo murders). But, unlike the New York Times, Le Monde refused to back down; the editor, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fenoglio, instead counterattacked, effectively calling Houellebecq a control freak.\n\nHe was able to be so defiant because there was much that was puzzling about Houellebecq\u2019s complaint. Fenoglio and the writer, Ariane Chemin, responded that every detail of the author\u2019s everyday life in the pieces had already appeared elsewhere with his consent (and to amusedly point out that they hadn\u2019t disclosed, pace Houellebecq, that he did his shopping at his local Monoprix). But also the author has put his personal life into the public domain in his fiction as well as when promoting it. And his self-depiction in the Goncourt-winning The Map and the Territory (in which the protagonist, an artist, creates a portrait of him) is far less lenient than Le Monde\u2019s portrayal: its \u201cMichel Houellebecq\u201d is a morose, alcoholic, latently suicidal, possibly paranoid near-recluse and misanthrope.\n\nVargas Llosa has been warier of making his private self public, but nevertheless his protest had puzzling aspects, too. The Hola! article has not been taken down, and visitors to hola.com will find he and Preysler graced the 1 July issue\u2019s cover and reappeared on holiday this week, with the literary grandee showing no sign of displeasure at being photographed and joining the media spectacle his book disdains.\n\nRather than being a cheap jibe, Cohen\u2019s ironic noting of his celebrity status continued the argument of a review that suggested he exemplifies the very mixing up of lowbrow and highbrow he criticises: as a regular newspaper columnist, a novelist whose film- and soap opera-influenced books are a \u201chigh-low blend\u201d, and now a B-lister fated to be \u201cpaparazzied\u201d.

I think it\u2019s more a game for the busy commuter who likes to pass the time by fiddling with their iPhone. It only really requires half your attention; I feel as though Nintendo deliberately tapped into that market to get people who don\u2019t normally play games to download the app. But you can\u2019t help but question how much you\u2019re really \u2018playing\u2019 the game when you\u2019re merely tapping the screen.\n\n\n\nYou can actually leave Mario up to his own devices for a while and he\u2019ll do his own thing.

Additionally, it\u2019s only playable with an internet connection, which seems like a ludicrous caveat when you\u2019ve already paid almost \u00a38.\n\n\n\nThe game itself is a slick, charming, and well-produced endless runner that is playable with one hand. The level-design is fantastic; each of the 24 stages has been crafted to be re-playable with harder difficulties in the shape of collectible coloured coins. I happily repeated the same levels several times, trying to figure out the exact route I needed to take, and when executed correctly it felt very rewarding. Super Mario Run is a polished, meticulously designed, and ultimately fun mobile title that does more than just appeal to nostalgia. However, it comes at a price that many casual gamers will find hard to justify.\n\nZia Murad, Dubai\n\n\u2018I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 4 out of 5\n\nI think the one hand operation is good. Most people dislike that Mario moves automatically, but I think this makes the game more challenging - like getting pink coins or grey coins. Most people just play the first three levels and stop, but I think the game just gets started from that point! I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast =(\n\n\n\nFor 9.99 the price is a bit high. It would be great if it was a free game but a one time payment is fine. It would be better if there was more of a social aspect, mini game option, or even the ability to battle with friends.\n\n\n\nM, Hong Kong\n\n\u2018My favourite thing about the game is they let me pay for it\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nNintendo has built a Mario game that feels like a Mario game, but is not hampered by the limits of a mobile. Mario looks like Mario, sounds like Mario, and most importantly for a Mario game jumps like Mario. Unlike an endless runner the stages are handcrafted, built to provide a modest challenge with precise positioning of coins, blocks, and enemies. The challenge of collecting five specific coloured coins drives you to retry each stage multiple times, and when you succeed, the five coins will be placed elsewhere.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a great game for a quick dip in and out of. A run takes mere moments which is perfect. It handles wonderfully, one thumb touch which does everything you want it to do. The design choice of having a chunk of unused space at the bottom of the screen means that unlike most mobile games I never feel like my touching the screen gets in the way of seeing the action. But my favourite thing about Super Mario Run: they let me pay for it. A one off payment unlocks everything I need. There is nothing pushing me to drop more money to buy new lives, or buy gems which are needed to purchase levels or anything like that. A one off \u00a38 payment for a quality game single handedly solves every problem I\u2019ve had with other mobile games. I look forward to completing it during the excessive loading times when fast travelling in Final Fantasy XV.\n\n\n\nJohn Price, Plymouth\n\n\u2018Terrible marketing\u2019\n\n\n\nRating: 2.5 out of 5\n\nPaying 10 bucks after a few levels is terrible marketing.

Its easily worth \u00a37.99 in my opinion. You play the first three levels, then decide if you want to pay - seems perfectly reasonable to me. I don\u2019t know why so many people expected to play the whole game for free.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t your average iOS shovel-ware - it\u2019s a crafted product with depth and replay value. On one hand it concerns me that people don\u2019t seem to be able to tell the difference - on the other, I suppose this is an inherent risk when aiming a product at the mass market. Yesterday, I spent \u00a36.50 for two coffees and a slice of shortcake, and \u00a37.99 for Super Mario Run.

The auto-run-forward of the portly plumber detracts nothing from the side scrolling platform action, instead allowing more attention to be paid to the at times frustrating pixel perfect jump. Speaking of pixels, the graphics are detailed and hi-res enough to satisfy modern eyes.\n\n\n\nThe Nintendo charm is ever present throughout and fans of Mario will be pleased with the look and tone of the package. Yes, the package. People bemoaned the \u00a37.99 charge upon reaching the first Koopa confrontation. However, in my opinion there is enough to satisfy. Six worlds, three levels and a boss battle in each. There\u2019s also a road rally which shifts the emphasis of the platforming action to style over course completion and enemy squashing. This leads to village building and toad pleasing mini games. There\u2019s more than enough here to justify eight quid and it\u2019s a few notches above other mobile gaming fare as well, as like it or lump it, Nintendo are still masters of the video game.

The ECB hoped financial institutions would invest the proceeds elsewhere in the eurozone economy and that the programme would drive down the value of the euro, making exports more competitive. The current phase of QE is due to finish in September, but Draghi has always said it would continue, \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d. With inflation at just 0.1% in November, he could shift that deadline into 2017.\n\nIncreasing the scale of monthly bond purchases\n\nDraghi and his colleagues could increase the value of the government bonds they buy each month, from the current \u20ac60bn a month level. However, some analysts argue there are risks that the supply of bonds is not big enough to accommodate a big expansion.

Photograph: DPA/Corbis\n\nCutting the deposit rate\n\nThe ECB already pays a negative deposit rate, of -0.2%, on reserves held at the central bank. In other words, banks must in effect pay the ECB for looking after their money: a measure aimed at keeping money flowing around the economy. The ECB could cut this rate further, which some analysts think could be as low as -0.4%.\n\nThere are also suggestions that it could introduce a two-tier deposit rate, similar to that adopted by the Danish and Swiss central banks, to penalise banks more heavily, the more of their reserves they keep out of circulation at the ECB.\n\nForward guidance\n\nDraghi is renowned for using carefully honed statements to direct the markets, most memorably when he promised at the height of the eurozone crisis in July 2012 that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to safeguard the single currency. He could use a similar dose of verbal reassurance on Thursday to convince investors the ECB will not let the economy slide into deflation.\n\nNothing at all\n\nFew analysts are betting on it, but it\u2019s not impossible that the ECB could decide to sit on its hands.

Draghi is likely to face opposition on the ECB governing council, particularly from Germany, which does not believe more QE is appropriate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the ECB\u2019s announcement, attention will be focused on the foreign exchange markets, because QE tends to stimulate the economy by driving down the exchange rate and so boosting exports.\n\nHowever, this would come at a time when the prospect of a rise in US interest rates has strengthened the dollar."]], "2015-07-13": [[["Alan Yuhas"], "00:00:00", "The escape of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, Mexico\u2019s most notorious cartel boss, from a maximum-security prison by a mile-long tunnel, was evidently the last thing President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government expected from the kingpin \u2013 even if the drug lord had previously escaped from prison and shown a penchant for elaborate tunnels.\n\nEl Chapo escape: notorious drug lord tops list of world's most-wanted \u2013 again Read more\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto said last year that an escape would be \u201cmore than unfortunate, it would be unforgivable\u201d.

And plus, Milan has the money. I\u2019ve been doing well in my last two games, there are another six for me to prove myself. I feel in good shape physically at last and am relaxed.\u201d\n\nPremier League finances: the full club-by-club breakdown and verdict Read more\n\nLiverpool paid \u00a316m for Balotelli in August 2014 but, in his one season at Anfield he scored four goals in 28 matches, including only one in the Premier League.\n\nThe manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp is keen to offload him and there have already been inquiries from the Chinese Super League. His agent, Mino Raiola, has sounded out potential suitors for the troubled forward and clubs in China and Turkey have expressed a firm interest.\n\nThe Chinese Super League outspent the Premier League in January and that expenditure, following a declaration by the president, Xi Jingping, that China should become a football powerhouse, has prompted agents such as Raiola and Pini Zahavi to explore further deals for the summer."]], "2015-11-13": [[["Daniel Taylor"], "00:00:00", "Once again, England were reminded of their own shortcomings as soon as the standard of opposition goes up a notch. Roy Hodgson\u2019s team still have to learn the importance of taking better care of the ball in these fixtures and a clear sense of deja vu was left in their wake. Ten successive wins in qualifying for Euro 2016 have been followed by a clear defeat on the first occasion they play one of Europe\u2019s leading nations and by now, it all seems terribly predictable.\n\nIf there was one consolation, it was that England did avoid this game spiralling into the kind of ordeal that was threatened during the opening stages. Hodgson\u2019s players could hardly get a kick in those moments and after a difficult start they did at least play with a degree of composure during the middle part of the match. Ultimately, though, the moments of high quality came from Vicente del Bosque\u2019s side, most notably the wonderfully taken goal from their right-back, Mario P\u00e9rez, that set up the victory.\n\nThe defender\u2019s spinning volley was the outstanding moment of a night when Spain clocked up their seventh successive victory and England were beaten for the first time since the World Cup or, to put it another way, the last time they played a decent side.\n\nEngland\u2019s Tuesday friendly with France likely to be cancelled Read more\n\nSanti Cazorla added the second goal and, more than anything, it seemed like a reality check for the team with the best qualifying record for Euro 2016. England might have made light work of Lithuania, Estonia, San Marino, Switzerland and Slovenia, but Spain are a cut above, unable even to shoehorn Juan Mata, Santi Cazorla, Pedro Rodr\u00edguez and David de Gea into their starting XI. And they won while still leaving the distinct impression they were operating within themselves and that if the mood took them they may just really start to try.\n\nThe electronic scoreboard at one end of this roofless stadium, with the bats fluttering in the night sky, had almost ticked into its second minute before an England player had touched the ball from kickoff. The tone had been set and, having breezed through their Euro 2016 qualifying programme, this was a new challenge for Hodgson\u2019s men, chasing the ball and enduring long passages where the bottom line was that the other side were vastly superior on the ball. For England, there were times when their efforts to get it back were almost as futile as attempts by the Spanish fans to get the away end to join in with the Mexican wave.\n\nMore alarmingly, there was also a tendency when England did get the ball to give it straight back with remarkable alacrity. It is the lack of refinement in possession that can be startling and the tendency to rush passes. Spain, in stark contrast, make possession look easy.\n\nThey passed, they moved and they looked up to see where the next pass was. Spain no longer have a striker in the mould of David Villa or a peak Fernando Torres, but they wear down opponents with their rhythmical style.\n\nEngland, to give them their due, did also create a couple of half-chances during the closing stages of the first half. Chris Smalling and Phil Jones took good care of Diego Costa, who managed to go through the match without any confrontation, and the goals arrived at a point when Spain had started to look a little tepid in attack.\n\nAfter 72 minutes, Cesc F\u00e0bregas chipped a pass over Mario\u2019s shoulder and the right-back, coming inside Ryan Bertrand, turned elegantly to redirect the ball with a swivelling, diagonal volley into the far corner of the goal. It was a tremendous effort but Hodgson\u2019s irritation stemmed from the fact it came from Raheem Sterling losing the ball in an encouraging position.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn our lesson and remember that when we are playing a team of this quality we cannot afford to make technical mistakes,\u201d the manager said.\n\nHodgson immediately brought on Wayne Rooney and in the closing stages England\u2019s record scorer struck a volley into the turf that came up and hit the top of the crossbar. By then, however, Spain had scored again and the game was winding down. England\u2019s players must have been relieved Andr\u00e8s Iniesta played only the first half \u2013 Hodgson said afterwards a lot of his preparation had been around trying to subdue the Barcelona man \u2013 but his replacement, Nolito, also created problems on Spain\u2019s left. Nolito found Cazorla, who had replaced the injured Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara after 26 minutes, and the Arsenal midfielder curled home his shot.\n\nEngland\u2019s mitigation is their long list of absentees and they were dealt another blow late in the match when Michael Carrick was taken off on a stretcher having damaged ankle ligaments. Carrick is elegant enough to fit into Spain\u2019s midfield but his luckless run of injuries continues. In the unlikely event Tuesday\u2019s game against France goes ahead, he will be missing.\n\nOn a brighter note, Bertrand was always keen to break forward from his full-back position and Fabien Delph should be better for his first start since damaging a hamstring early in the game against Switzerland in September.\n\nFor the most part, however, there was not a great deal of opportunity for Ross Barkley and Harry Kane to build their understanding. Sterling was prominently involved but ran down too many cul-de-sacs and Hodgson did not try to dress it up afterwards. England, he said, had to make more use of the ball because when you give it away at this level it can be a long time before you get it back again.\n\nSpain v England: international friendly \u2013 as it happened!
